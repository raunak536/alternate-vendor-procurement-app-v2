Listed price and details, shipping on dry ice, storage \u201320\u00b0C.  \n  **Confidence:** High  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.9 \u2013 *Exact kit from Echelon, sold by an established supplier (Tebu-bio).*  \n  **Reason:** Product page confirms catalog number K-6000 and Echelon Biosciences as manufacturer. Meets all specified criteria (format, assay type, sample compatibility).  \n  **Concerns:** European supplier (shipment to India may have lead time); relatively high price.  \n\n- **Vendor:** Amsbio (UK/US/CH)  \n  **Product:** Hyaluronidase Assay Kit (\u201cRAZIE\u201d Assay, Kit Ra003-01-HAK)  \n  **URL:** https://www.amsbio.com/hyaluronidase-assay-kit-ra003-01-hak  \n  **Description:** Enzyme activity assay measuring mammalian hyaluronidase by substrate degradation (RAZIE technology). Provides quantitative activity data (used for inhibitor screening or enzyme quantification). Kit includes PRO-enzymatic reagents, uses 96-well plate. Note: this is an activity assay (not immuno-ELISA).  \n  **Confidence:** Medium  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.7 \u2013 *Close equivalent measuring hyaluronidase activity (different format).*  \n  **Reason:** Although not an ELISA, Amsbio\u2019s kit addresses the same need (reports hyaluronidase activity) and is made by a respected enzyme kit manufacturer. Useful if the exact ELISA format is not mandatory.  \n  **Concerns:** Uses a different assay method (RAZIE) instead of immunoassay; likely higher cost ($1715); may require different instrumentation.  \n\n- **Vendor:** Biorbyt (UK)  \n  **Product:** Hyaluronidase Enzymatic Assay Kit (Catalog ORB608267, 96 assays)  \n  **URL:** https://www.biorbyt.com/hyaluronidase-enzymatic-assay-orb608267.html  \n  **Description:** Chromogenic enzymatic assay (96-well format) for hyaluronidase activity. Reported range ~28\u2013896 U/mL, sensitivity ~2 U/mL. Targets cell culture supernatants and other samples. Measures turbidity; results read on standard plate reader.  \n  **Confidence:** Medium  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.6 \u2013 *Acceptable activity assay alternative.*  \n  **Reason:** The kit measures hyaluronidase activity quantitatively, although by detecting reaction products (turbidity) rather than an ELISA. It is a complete 96-well kit from a known supplier (Biorbyt) with validated range/sensitivity.  \n  **Concerns:** Not an immunoassay; performance and sample compatibility (pharmaceutical prep, cell supernatant only specified) differ from intended use. Documentation/availability details limited on site.  \n\n"

        "raw_response": "- **Sigma-Aldrich (Merck)** \u2013 *Nalgene\u00ae sterile, single-use Erlenmeyer flask with vented closure (PETG, 125 mL, case of 24 ea)* \u2013 [Product Page](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/KR/en/product/sigma/tmo41150125).  These flasks are made of medical-grade PETG (XD resin) and come gamma-sterilized with a 0.2 \u00b5m vented HDPE screw cap for sterile gas exchange.  They are graduated, non-cytotoxic, USP Class VI compliant and suitable for shaking incubators.  **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.9 \u2013 Exact match from a tier-1 supplier (Merck Sigma/Nalgene) with confirmed specs.  **Reason:** Meets all requirements (vented PETG, 125 mL, sterile, shaker-compatible).  **Concerns:** Currently \u201cContact Customer Service for Availability\u201d on the site (likely backordered), and regional site required inquiry.      \n\n- **Thermo Fisher Scientific (Nalgene)** \u2013 *Nalgene\u2122 Single-Use PETG Erlenmeyer Flask with Plain Bottom (125 mL, sterile)* \u2013 [Product Page](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4115-0125).  This is the standard Nalgene PETG flask (plain flat bottom) sold as a pack of sterile flasks, vented (38\u00d7430 mm caps) or non-vented variants. It\u2019s made from USP-grade PETG, gamma-irradiated, and available with hydrophobic vent caps or solid caps. **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.9 \u2013 Exact product match from the primary manufacturer.  **Reason:** Nalgene is highly reputable; catalog lists 125 mL vented (4115-0125) and non-vented (4112-0125) options with identical specs.  **Concerns:** Listing shows \u201cAvailable Soon \u2013 part #: 4115-0125\u201d and \u201cContact for Availability,\u201d indicating possible backorder.  \n\n- **Tarsons (India)** \u2013 *Sterile Erlenmeyer Cell Culture Flask, Baffled base, PETG with Vented HDPE closure (125 mL)* \u2013 [Product Page](https://www.tarsons.com/product/sterile-erlenmeyer-cell-culture-flask-baffled-base-petg-with-vented-hdpe-closure/).  Made in India from medical-grade PETG (USP Class VI), these flasks have molded graduations, gamma sterilization, and a hydrophobic 0.2 \u00b5m PTFE vent cap (HDPE body). The baffled bottom design improves mixing and gas exchange. Each flask is individually wrapped; pack size is 24 per case.  **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.9 \u2013 An exact-match product from a known biotech plasticware manufacturer.  **Reason:** Specification (125 mL, PETG, sterile, vented, baffled) aligns fully; additional features (non-cytotoxic, autoclave rating \u201cNo\u201d, -40\u201370\u00b0C range) suit bioprocess use.  **Concerns:** None significant; Tarsons is local to India, but international shipments may still be needed.  \n\n- **CellTreat (via Quality Biological)** \u2013 *CellTreat 125 mL Erlenmeyer Flask, Solid Cap, Plain Bottom, PETG, Sterile* \u2013 [Product Page](https://www.qualitybiological.com/product/125ml-erlenmeyer-flask-solid-cap-plain-bottom-petg-sterile/).  These single-use flasks are molded from medical-grade virgin PETG (reducing gas permeability), gamma-sterilized in individual bags. The plain-bottom flasks come with green HDPE solid screw caps (no vent). They are USP Class VI compliant and suitable for cell or microbial culture.  **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.8 \u2013 Exact 125 mL PETG sterile flask with a solid (non-vented) cap.  **Reason:** Matches query except closure type; reputable lab supplier.  **Concerns:** Only solid-cap version (no vent), and packaged 1 per bag (12 per case), which may differ from some vented-closure requests.  \n\n- **NEST Biotech (Genaxy)** \u2013 *NEST PETG Erlenmeyer Flask* \u2013 [Product Page](https://www.genaxy.com/products/details/213).  NEST offers 125 mL PETG shaker flasks in both baffled and plain bottoms. The caps come in seal (solid) or ventilated versions with 0.2 \u00b5m hydrophobic filters. They are E-beam sterilized (SAL 10^-6), non-pyrogenic, DNase/RNase free, individually shrink-wrapped, and graded.   **Confidence:** Medium. **Score:** 0.7 \u2013 Close equivalent produced by a recognized manufacturer (NEST Scientific).  **Reason:** The specs (125 mL, PETG, sterile, with vent/screw-cap options) match well.  **Concerns:** Lower brand recognition outside China, may require import and lead time; site indicates \u201cRequest a Quote.\u201d  \n\n- **Eisco Labs** \u2013 *Eisco 125 mL Sterile PETG Erlenmeyer Flask, Vented, Flat Bottom (Pack of 1)* \u2013 [Product Page](https://www.eiscolabs.com/products/ch5238).  This lab-grade flask is gamma-irradiated (USP Class VI) PETG with a vented HDPE screw cap for sterile gas exchange. It is labeled for biopharma/cell culture use.  **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.9 \u2013 Direct match to requirement (125 mL PETG sterile, vented, flat-bottom).  **Reason:** Well-specified product from a known supplier.  **Concerns:** Sold as pack of 1 (single flask); unit price high if bulk purchases needed.  \n\nEach listed vendor provides an exact or near-exact 125 mL PETG Erlenmeyer flask suitable for cell/microbial culture.  All entries are sterile, non-cytotoxic, and shake-incubator compatible.  Ratings are based on match quality and vendor reliability; concerns note availability or packaging issues (e.g. some items are backordered or sold individually)."

Available on Mediray\u2019s laboratory catalog, this is the BioM\u00e9rieux\u2010brand triple-wrapped contact plates (100\u00d755 mm) pre-poured with TSA for surface sampling. Confidence: **high (0.95)**. Recommendation Score: **0.95** \u2013 an exact product match (same brand and specifications) from a well-known distributor. Reason: Exact BioM\u00e9rieux Count-Tact product in the specified pack size, with clear description and chart on the site. Concerns: Requires user login to see the price; shipping lead times from New Zealand to India may apply.\n\n- **Vendor: Dabos Online (Europe)** \u2013 *Pack of 10 Irradiated Contact Plates Media, BioMerieux \u2013 43699, 100 plates, Irradiated Count-Tact 3P agar (Made-to-Order)*. This listing (at dabos.com) matches the BioM\u00e9rieux 43699 product \u2013 10 triple-bagged plate stacks (total 100 plates) of Count-Tact 3P TSA. Confidence: **high (0.90)**. Recommendation Score: **0.90** \u2013 an exact product match via a major laboratory supplier. Reason: Product name and details explicitly match the Count-Tact 43699 description, indicating correct item and manufacturer. Concerns: It is \u201cmade-to-order\u201d so likely not immediately in stock; the site requires a commercial address or account to order and see pricing.\n\n- **Vendor: Thermo Fisher Scientific (Fisher Scientific)** \u2013 *Tryptone Soya Agar Irradiated Triple Wrap Contact Plate* (Product Code 11913732, 10 pcs/pkg). This is a 55 mm TSA contact plate, gamma-irradiated and triple-wrapped for sterile delivery (10 plates per pack). Confidence: **medium (0.80)**. Recommendation Score: **0.80** \u2013 a close equivalent (different brand) from a tier-1 vendor. Reason: The technology (triple-wrapped, sterile TSA contact plates) is functionally identical to Count-Tact 3P plates, and product specifications are similar. Concerns: Comes in packs of 10 (so ten packs are needed to get 100 plates); it\u2019s a Thermo/Fisher-branded item (not Count-Tact brand). Availability is generally good on Fisher catalogs, but confirm lead time.\n\n- **Vendor: Thermo Fisher Scientific (Fisher Scientific)** \u2013 *Sabouraud Dextrose Agar Irradiated Triple Wrap Contact Plate (VHP Ind.) 100/Pk, 55 mm.* (Product Code 15486030). This offering is a 100-pack of 55 mm quadruple-wrapped Sabouraud agar contact plates with VHP indicator, matching the triple-pack style (designed for fungi). Confidence: **medium (0.70)**. Recommendation Score: **0.60** \u2013 provides exactly 100 plates triple-wrapped, but note brand and viability. Reason: The pack size (100) and protection level match the query, making it an exact-quantity alternative. Concerns: The site indicates this item is currently discontinued/unavailable; the brand is Thermo, not Count-Tact; and price/account info require login. It would need verification of restocking or alternatives.\n\n- **Vendor: Merck KGaA (MilliporeSigma)** \u2013 *Tryptic Soy Agar Ready-to-use Contact Plates, 55 mm, \u03b3-irradiated, pack of 10 triple-wrapped (ISO/BAM/USP grade)*. (Product No. 1.46231). These are Millipore-branded TSA contact plates with neutralizers (ICR plate) triple-packed, 10 plates per box. Confidence: **medium (0.80)**. Recommendation Score: **0.80** \u2013 a solid equivalent alternative from a leading supplier. Reason: The product is a gamma-irradiated contact plate of similar formula and packaging (triple wrap) for environmental monitoring, comparable to Count-Tact TSA. Concerns: Only 10 plates per pack (so need 10 packs for 100 plates); different brand name (MilliporeSigma). Ordering may require contacting a sales rep or distributor for pricing and lead times."

Material is EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene) with 0.4 mm (16 mil) thickness, designed for repeated autoclave sterilization and strong resistance to hydrogen peroxide and other disinfectants ([www.ansell.com](https://www.ansell.com/int/en/products/alphatec-epdm-isolator-glove-85-502#:~:text=Port%20size%3A%20254mm%2F10%E2%80%9D%20Thickness%3A%200,suitable%20for%20disposal%20by%20incineration)) ([www.ansell.com](https://www.ansell.com/int/en/products/alphatec-epdm-isolator-glove-85-502#:~:text=,SHAPE%20Ambidextrous)). Ambidextrous, FDA 21 CFR 177 compliant and rated for chemical protection. (Vendor: Ansell, product URL: https://www.ansell.com/int/en/products/alphatec-epdm-isolator-glove-85-502)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Close match in length and use, thickness is 16 mil instead of 8 mil). *Recommendation: 0.75* \u2013 Ansell is a tier-1 PPE vendor; product is the correct EPDM material and length. *Reason:* Nearly all specifications match except the glove is thicker than requested. *Concerns:* Thicker glove may reduce dexterity. Availability is generally good for Ansell, but this specific model is non-sterile (for RABS/isolator use) and thicker than 8 mil.  \n\n- **Demaco Holland (Glovebox Supplies) \u2013 *EPDM glove, 8\u2033 port, 15 mil, 32\u2033 length*** \u2013 EPDM glove for glovebox port (Item 8E1532A0975).

(Vendor: Demaco; URL: https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Exact product specification except thickness). *Recommendation: 0.72* \u2013 Demaco is a reputable specialty glovebox supplier and this listing matches the material, port size, length, and user size exactly ([demaco-vacuum.com](https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/#:~:text=32%E2%80%B3%20long%20%28800mm%29%2CHand%20size%209,4)). *Reason:* EPDM, 32\u2033 length, ambidextrous and FDA-compliant as required for pharma use. *Concerns:* Offered thickness is 15 mil vs requested 8 mil (double the thickness). Slight concern that Demaco sells per glove, and availability may require a minimum order or take 1 week delivery ([demaco-vacuum.com](https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/#:~:text=32%E2%80%B3%20long%20%28800mm%29%2CHand%20size%209,4mm%29%20thick)).  \n\n- **Albiox (Piercan) \u2013 *Isolator Glove EPDM black/white*** \u2013 Dual-layer EPDM (black outside, white lining) long isolator glove, halogen-free, powder-donned.

(Vendor: Albiox (distributor in Finland, global reach); Product URL: https://albiox.com/product/epdm-black-epdm-white-isolator-glove/)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Material and use match, but nominal thickness 16\u201324 mil). *Recommendation: 0.70* \u2013 Piercan (through Albiox) is a major glovebox glove maker (ISO certified). The two thickness options cover the needed EPDM type. *Reason:* Exact EPDM glove for isolator use; vendor is specialized and high-quality. *Concerns:* Thinner available version is still 16 mil (vs requested 8 mil). Pack and lot requirements (min 10) and sterilization status (sold sterile, etc.) must be clarified. Possibly longer lead time due to specialty product.  \n\n- **GloveBoxGloves (UK) \u2013 *EPDM Gauntlets & Sleeves*** \u2013 EPDM long sleeves (gloves) designed for glovebox and lab use.

The product listing (SKU G-EDP) describes 32\u2033 gloves with hand size 9 and 8\u2033/10\u2033 port compatibility ([gloveboxgloves.co.uk](https://gloveboxgloves.co.uk/product/edpm-gaunlets-and-sleeves/#:~:text=Specification)). (Vendor: GloveBoxGloves, UK; URL: https://gloveboxgloves.co.uk/product/edpm-gaunlets-and-sleeves/)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Excellent match on length and material, slightly thicker). *Recommendation: 0.72* \u2013 Specialist glovebox supplier and global shipping available. *Reason:* Direct EPDM glove product with correct dimensions (close) and explicitly intended for lab/pharma glovebox use. *Concerns:* Thickness is 15 mil instead of 8 mil, and only hand size 9 listed. No explicit sterility certification mentioned. Stock status should be confirmed.  \n\n- **Glove Box Australia \u2013 *EPDM GLOVE \u2013 8.5 \u2013 4/10 \u2013 800 \u2013 \u00d8156*** \u2013 Ambidextrous EPDM black glove (Piercan brand), hand size 8.5 (9\u2033), 0.4 mm (15 mil) thick, 800 mm long ([www.labhub.au](https://www.labhub.au/products/epdm-glove-8-5-4-10-800mm-o156?Title=Default+Title#:~:text=Suitable%20for%20every%20glove%20box,manufacturers)).

(Vendor: Glove Box Australia; URL: https://www.gloveboxaustralia.com.au/products/epdm-glove-8-5-4-10-800mm-o156)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Correct length and EPDM; thickness mismatch). *Recommendation: 0.70* \u2013 Reputable supplier in Asia-Pacific (sources Piercan gloves). Exact match of EPDM long glove (31.5\u2033, size 8.5). *Reason:* Close spec and clear vendor specialization. *Concerns:* Only one thickness offered (0.4 mm). MOQ of 20 indicates bulk ordering; ensure availability.  \n\n- **Tarun Gloves (India) \u2013 *EPDM Isolator Gloves*** \u2013 EPDM heavyweight glove for gloveboxes. (Site only shows a general \u201cEPDM Gloves\u201d offering in \u201cIsolator Gloves\u201d category). Vendor claims EPDM material suitable for pharmaceutical environments ([www.tarungloves.com](https://www.tarungloves.com/isolator-gloves.html#:~:text=Color%20%20)). (Vendor: Tarun Gloves, India; URL: https://www.tarungloves.com/isolator-gloves.html)  \n  *Confidence: Low* (Vague details; no length or thickness given). *Recommendation: 0.50* \u2013 Indian manufacturer with EPDM chemical gloves. *Reason:* Material matches query (EPDM), and local presence could offer competitive pricing. *Concerns:* Lacks product specification (length, thickness not listed). Quality and certifications (FDA, ISO) are uncertain. Likely need to verify actual glove parameters and minimum order quantities."

        "raw_response": "1. **Cole-Parmer (Contec brand)** \u2013 *Contec EasySat\u2122 Bucketless Floor Mop Head (Smooth); 32/Pk* \u2013 [Product page](https://www.coleparmer.com/i/contec-easysat-mop-head-for-bucketless-floor-mop-smooth-32-pk/0941131) \u2013 This is the Contec EasySat\u2122 mop head (smooth, angled) designed for use with the Contec bucketless mop system. It is made of ultraclean polyester/ester foam (VertiKlean) and is autoclavable. It attaches via hook-and-loop to the EasySat handle and eliminates the need for a mop bucket. Comes non-sterile, pack of 32. **Confidence:** High. **Rec. Score:** 0.95 \u2013 Exact Contec product, from a reputable distributor. **Reason:** Exact match to bucketless pharmaceutical mop head; user-oriented vendor site. **Concerns:** Sold in UK currency; verify shipping to India; Non-sterile (sterile gamma-irradiated version available separately).\n\n2. **Foamtec (PharmaMOP)** \u2013 *Foamtec PharmaMOP\u2122 Cleanroom Mop Heads, Sterile* \u2013 [Product page](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/pharmamop-cleanroom-mop-heads-sterile/19304821) \u2013 This sterile mop head is part of Foamtec\u2019s PharmaMOP system (high-capacity, drip-resistant design). It features a 0.125\u2033 foam core with ultrapure polyester cover (gamma-irradiated, SAL 10\u207b\u2076) for heavy-duty disinfectant cleaning. Suitable for ISO 5-7 cleanrooms, compatible with bleach, IPA, etc. (Other styles include non-sterile and textured versions under same catalog). **Confidence:** Medium-High. **Rec. Score:** 0.80 \u2013 Good match in concept (drip-resistant, ergonomic handle system) and manufacturer. **Reason:** PharmaMOP is designed for aseptic processing areas and meets cleanroom standards; sold through Fisher Sci. **Concerns:** Not explicitly \u201cbucketless\u201d handle (requires manipulating scrubber), but described as \u201cdrip-resistant, no wringer\u201d. Ensure it fits the internal-dispense handle system. Pricing and availability need checking.\n\n3. **SterileMate** \u2013 *EasyFlo\u2122 Bucketless Mop System* \u2013 [Product page](https://sterilemate.com/product/easyflo-bucketless-mop-system/) \u2013 SterileMate\u2019s EasyFlo is a bucketless floor mop system with a built-in reservoir (28 oz.) and palm-trigger dispensing. The site lists a starter kit (handle, tank, 18\u2033 frame, 2 flat microfiber pads) and replacement handles. The mop covers up to ~3000 ft\u00b2, with a lightweight aluminum frame. Kits include 18\u2033 flat wet mop pads (sold separately). **Confidence:** Medium. **Rec. Score:** 0.65 \u2013 Close match, intended for clean/sterile areas. **Reason:** Explicitly bucketless design, marketed for sterile environments. **Concerns:** Smaller capacity (28 oz vs 52 oz), not explicitly ISO-certified; primarily shows system overview, less technical detail. Availability and India shipping must be verified.\n\n4. **Hillyard/Boardwalk** \u2013 *Boardwalk Bucketless Microfiber Mop System, 18\u2033 W, Blue* \u2013 [Product page](https://www.hillyard.com/Wet-Mops/Boardwalk-Bucketless-Microfiber-Mop-System-18-W-Blue/p/BWKBWMS16MFM) \u2013 A general-purpose bucketless mop kit with a 865 mL internal tank and 18\u2033 wide microfiber pad. The design dispenses solution directly to the mop head\u2019s high-weight microfiber pad. Marketed for efficiency (saves water/chemicals, reduces contamination). **Confidence:** Low-Medium. **Rec. Score:** 0.50 \u2013 Fair match (true bucketless concept) but not specifically \u201cpharmaceutical grade\u201d. **Reason:** Well-known janitorial brand (Boardwalk) selling a bucketless system, so conceptually fits. **Concerns:** No claims of cleanroom/GMP compliance or certification; not gamma-sterilizable; likely not validated for particle/contamination control in pharma settings.\n\n5. **Biomed Pharmacare (India)** \u2013 *Bucketless Mopping System for Pharma Use* \u2013 [Product page](https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/bucketless-mopping-system-for-pharma-use-20635866191.html) \u2013 An Indian-made mop system described as \u201cbucketless\u201d for pharmaceutical use. Features a plastic handle and looped-end microfiber mop head (red) with no separate bucket. **Confidence:** Low. **Rec. Score:** 0.35 \u2013 Loose match. **Reason:** Claims to be bucketless and intended for pharma, and is an India-based manufacturer (potential for local procurement). **Concerns:** Product details are minimal (IndiaMART listing only). \u201cDry mop\u201d suggests it may not involve dispensing liquids. No information on cleanroom certification or compliance; quality and applicability are unclear. Highest caution on fit for critical environments."

This system is widely used for parallel cell culture/fermentation in bioprocess development.  \n  **URL Verified:** Yes (loads valid product page).  \n  **Confidence:** High \u2013 Exact match (original manufacturer) with verified URL.  \n  **Recommendation:** 0.9 \u2013 Tier-1 supplier with proven product. Well-established in bioprocess development.  \n  **Reasons:** Sartorius is a leading biopharma equipment company; the Ambr 250 is the specified system. The product page confirms features (100\u2013250 mL, single-use vessels, integrated control) that match requirements.  \n  **Concerns:** None specific (product is sold and supported globally). If any, slightly higher price or lead time due to popularity, but no stock issues noted.\n\n- **Manufacturer:** Eppendorf \u2013 *DASbox\u00ae Mini Bioreactor System* \u2013 [Product Page](https://www.eppendorf.com/th-en/Products/Bioprocess/Bioprocess-Controllers/DASbox-Mini-Bioreactor-System-p-PF-133566)  \n  **Description:** Parallel bench-top bioreactor platform supporting up to 24 glass or single-use vessels (BioBLU\u00ae) in parallel. Designed for microbial and mammalian cell cultures, it covers small working volumes of ~60\u2013250 mL per vessel ([www.eppendorf.com](https://www.eppendorf.com/th-en/Products/Bioprocess/Bioprocess-Controllers/DASbox-Mini-Bioreactor-System-p-PF-133566#:~:text=The%20DASbox%20Mini%20Bioreactor%20System,down%20applications)) ([www.eppendorf.com](https://www.eppendorf.com/th-en/Products/Bioprocess/Bioprocess-Controllers/DASbox-Mini-Bioreactor-System-p-PF-133566#:~:text=and%20process%20development%20in%20small,optimal%20tool%20for%20efficient%20process)). Includes integrated control of pH, temperature, DO, pumps and mass flow controllers. Suitable for high-throughput process development and scale-down experiments.  \n  **URL Verified:** Yes (loads product page with specs).  \n  **Confidence:** High \u2013 Eppendorf is a top-tier life-science equipment supplier, and the DASbox system is an established multi-parallel bioreactor.  \n  **Recommendation:** 0.9 \u2013 Excellent match. Eppendorf is well-known and that model meets the volume/parallel requirements.  \n  **Reasons:** Tier-1 manufacturer; the DASbox Mini specifically lists 60\u2013250 mL and up to 24 vessels. It offers modular expansion and automation compatibility, making it highly suitable for scalable upstream development.  \n  **Concerns:** None critical. (Eppendorf products are globally supported, though the Thai/English site was used \u2013 a US/EN URL could be substituted if needed; offering multiple language indicates wide availability.)\n\n- **Manufacturer:** INFORS HT (Merck Millipore) \u2013 *Multifors\u00ae 2 Bench-Top Parallel Bioreactor System* \u2013 [Product Page](https://infors-ht.com/en/products/bioreactors/bench-top-bioreactors/multifors-2)  \n  **Description:** A configurable parallel benchtop reactor system. One control unit can run up to 6 vessels (glass), with vessel options including 400 mL (115\u2013250 mL working volume) ([infors-ht.com](https://infors-ht.com/en/products/bioreactors/bench-top-bioreactors/multifors-2#:~:text=Product%20specifications)), 750 mL (180\u2013500 mL working), or 1400 mL (320\u20131000 mL). Magnetic drives and integrated pumps/MFCs minimize footprint. Designed for microbial/fermentation use, it allows similar sensors and scales as production systems.  \n  **URL Verified:** Yes (loads product info and specs).  \n  **Confidence:** High \u2013 INFORS HT (now part of Merck Life Science) is a recognized biotech equipment manufacturer.  \n  **Recommendation:** 0.8 \u2013 Strong alternative. Known parallel system with matching scale (115\u2013250 mL).  \n  **Reasons:** INFORS is an established bioreactor supplier (infors-ht.com). The Multifors 2 explicitly supports 115\u2013250 mL working volumes per vessel, matching ambr\u2019s range. Its parallel design (up to 6-fold) and industrial-grade sensors suit scalable applications.  \n  **Concerns:** The website shows glass vessels (not single-use). If single-use or disposable elements are needed, additional components or adaptation might be required. However, INFORS does offer single-use options on request.\n\n- **Manufacturer:** PBS Biotech \u2013 *PBS-0.1 Mini Vertical-Wheel Bioreactor* \u2013 [Product Page](https://www.pbsbiotech.com/pbs-01-mini-bioreactors)  \n  **Description:** A specialized single-use bioreactor for cell culture (stem cells, immunotherapies). Uses a patented vertical-wheel mixing system. Supports working volumes of ~60\u2013100 mL ([www.pbsbiotech.com](https://www.pbsbiotech.com/pbs-01-mini-bioreactors#:~:text=The%20PBS,scale%20production)) (bench-scale). It is a benchtop system (PBS-Mini base unit) with enclosed single-use vessels; simple aseptic handling and regulatory-compliant materials (ideal for cell therapy development).  \n  **URL Verified:** Yes (official product page).  \n  **Confidence:** Medium \u2013 PBS Biotech is an emerging but reputable company in advanced bioreactors.  \n  **Recommendation:** 0.7 \u2013 Good specialty alternative, but note volume range slightly smaller.   \n  **Reasons:** PBS is known for cutting-edge single-use vessel technology. The PBS-0.1 Mini matches small-volume range (60\u2013100 mL) and is built for high cell viability. It may serve similar experiments, especially where gentle mixing (vertical impeller) is desired.  \n  **Concerns:** Working volume max (100 mL) is below 250 mL, so users needing higher volume would have to use fewer vessels or scale up to PBS-0.5 model. It\u2019s designed for cell therapy processes, so microbial fermentations might not be its focus. Ensure compatibility with process needs.\n\n- **Manufacturer:** H.E.L Group \u2013 *BioXplorer\u00ae 100 (Parallel 8 Bioreactor Platform)* \u2013 [Product Page](https://helgroup.com/products/bioreactors/bioxplorer-100/)  \n  **Description:** A multi-parallel stirred-tank system for aerobic cultures, with 8 configurable bioreactor vessels. Working volume range is ~50\u2013150 mL per vessel ([helgroup.com](https://helgroup.com/products/bioreactors/bioxplorer-100/#:~:text=The%20BioXplorer%20100%20is%20a,as%2050%20ml%2C%C2%A0%20the%20BioXplorer)). Each reactor has a glass body and stainless lid; sensors can be independently configured. Controlled by H.E.L\u2019s WinISO system. Emphasizes automated liquid/addition control and high-throughput data.  \n  **URL Verified:** Yes (working product page with specs).  \n  **Confidence:** Medium \u2013 H.E.L Group is a smaller specialized manufacturer, mainly known in fermentation R&D.  \n  **Recommendation:** 0.6 \u2013 Acceptable as an alternative.  \n  **Reasons:** The BioXplorer 100 meets the concept (parallel bioreactors, ~50\u2013150 mL) closely. H.E.L is ISO-certified and serves pharma/biotech labs. This platform is used for fermentation screening and process development.  \n  **Concerns:** Less well-known than Tier-1 brands. Maximum volume (150 mL) is below 250 mL, so uses slightly smaller vessels; however, multiple runs can compensate. Regional availability may vary; confirm local support or lead times."
