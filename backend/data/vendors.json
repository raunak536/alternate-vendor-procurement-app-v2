Quantitative immunoassay (96-well plate) for measuring hyaluronidase activity in biological samples (validated for human serum, plasma, urine, etc.). HA substrate is pre-coated in each well to quantify activity.  \n  **Confidence:** High  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.9 – *Exact product match from a reputable distributor (uses Echelon’s K-6000 code).*  \n  **Reason:** This listing is the same Echelon kit (K-6000) in the required format, with full specifications matching the query. 2BScientific is a known supplier of research kits.  \n  **Concerns:** Region restrictions (ordered from EU, not listed outside UK/EU) and availability (“Not available in your region” flag suggests ordering limitations).  \n\n- **Vendor:** MoBiTec/BioZol (Germany)  \n  **Product:** Hyaluronidase Activity ELISA (Echelon Biosciences kit, Cat# ECH-K-6000, 96-well)  \n  **URL:** https://www.mobitec.com/products/lipidomics/kits-assays/ech-k-6000-1x96wells-kit/hyaluronidase-activity-elisa-echelon-product-code-k-6000-1x96wells-kit  \n  **Description:** Direct Echelon Biosciences kit listing. 96-well ELISA measuring hyaluronidase enzyme activity (uses HA substrate in wells). Validated for human sera, plasma, urine, and includes purified bovine hyaluronidase. Storage at –20°C.  \n  **Confidence:** High  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.9 – *Exact Echelon product offered by a major European distributor.*  \n  **Reason:** The product description and supplier (Echelon) exactly match the query. MoBiTec (BioZol) is a reliable supplier in Europe.  \n  **Concerns:** Shipping/storage (requires dry ice, –20°C) and regional availability (not sold in France/Italy, per site notes).  \n\n- **Vendor:** Tebu-bio (Europe)  \n  **Product:** Hyaluronidase Activity ELISA – Kit (Echelon Biosciences, Cat# K-6000, 96T)  \n  **URL:** https://www.tebubio.com/en_fr_eur/hyaluronidase-activity-elisa-117k-6000-kit.html  \n  **Description:** Echelon Biosciences Hyaluronidase Activity ELISA kit (K-6000) sold by Tebu-bio. Same quantitative immunoassay format (96-well plate) for HA-degrading enzyme activity. Listed price and details, shipping on dry ice, storage –20°C.  \n  **Confidence:** High  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.9 – *Exact kit from Echelon, sold by an established supplier (Tebu-bio).*  \n  **Reason:** Product page confirms catalog number K-6000 and Echelon Biosciences as manufacturer. Meets all specified criteria (format, assay type, sample compatibility).  \n  **Concerns:** European supplier (shipment to India may have lead time); relatively high price.  \n\n- **Vendor:** Amsbio (UK/US/CH)  \n  **Product:** Hyaluronidase Assay Kit (“RAZIE” Assay, Kit Ra003-01-HAK)  \n  **URL:** https://www.amsbio.com/hyaluronidase-assay-kit-ra003-01-hak  \n  **Description:** Enzyme activity assay measuring mammalian hyaluronidase by substrate degradation (RAZIE technology). Provides quantitative activity data (used for inhibitor screening or enzyme quantification). Kit includes PRO-enzymatic reagents, uses 96-well plate. Note: this is an activity assay (not immuno-ELISA).  \n  **Confidence:** Medium  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.7 – *Close equivalent measuring hyaluronidase activity (different format).*  \n  **Reason:** Although not an ELISA, Amsbio’s kit addresses the same need (reports hyaluronidase activity) and is made by a respected enzyme kit manufacturer. Useful if the exact ELISA format is not mandatory.  \n  **Concerns:** Uses a different assay method (RAZIE) instead of immunoassay; likely higher cost ($1715); may require different instrumentation.  \n\n- **Vendor:** Biorbyt (UK)  \n  **Product:** Hyaluronidase Enzymatic Assay Kit (Catalog ORB608267, 96 assays)  \n  **URL:** https://www.biorbyt.com/hyaluronidase-enzymatic-assay-orb608267.html  \n  **Description:** Chromogenic enzymatic assay (96-well format) for hyaluronidase activity. Reported range ~28–896 U/mL, sensitivity ~2 U/mL. Targets cell culture supernatants and other samples. Measures turbidity; results read on standard plate reader.  \n  **Confidence:** Medium  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.6 – *Acceptable activity assay alternative.*  \n  **Reason:** The kit measures hyaluronidase activity quantitatively, although by detecting reaction products (turbidity) rather than an ELISA. It is a complete 96-well kit from a known supplier (Biorbyt) with validated range/sensitivity.  \n  **Concerns:** Not an immunoassay; performance and sample compatibility (pharmaceutical prep, cell supernatant only specified) differ from intended use.

        "raw_response": "- **Sigma-Aldrich (Merck)** – *Nalgene® sterile, single-use Erlenmeyer flask with vented closure (PETG, 125 mL, case of 24 ea)* – [Product Page](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/KR/en/product/sigma/tmo41150125).  These flasks are made of medical-grade PETG (XD resin) and come gamma-sterilized with a 0.2 µm vented HDPE screw cap for sterile gas exchange.  They are graduated, non-cytotoxic, USP Class VI compliant and suitable for shaking incubators.  **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.9 – Exact match from a tier-1 supplier (Merck Sigma/Nalgene) with confirmed specs.  **Reason:** Meets all requirements (vented PETG, 125 mL, sterile, shaker-compatible).  **Concerns:** Currently “Contact Customer Service for Availability” on the site (likely backordered), and regional site required inquiry.      \n\n- **Thermo Fisher Scientific (Nalgene)** – *Nalgene™ Single-Use PETG Erlenmeyer Flask with Plain Bottom (125 mL, sterile)* – [Product Page](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4115-0125).  This is the standard Nalgene PETG flask (plain flat bottom) sold as a pack of sterile flasks, vented (38×430 mm caps) or non-vented variants. It’s made from USP-grade PETG, gamma-irradiated, and available with hydrophobic vent caps or solid caps. **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.9 – Exact product match from the primary manufacturer.  **Reason:** Nalgene is highly reputable; catalog lists 125 mL vented (4115-0125) and non-vented (4112-0125) options with identical specs.  **Concerns:** Listing shows “Available Soon – part #: 4115-0125” and “Contact for Availability,” indicating possible backorder.  \n\n- **Tarsons (India)** – *Sterile Erlenmeyer Cell Culture Flask, Baffled base, PETG with Vented HDPE closure (125 mL)* – [Product Page](https://www.tarsons.com/product/sterile-erlenmeyer-cell-culture-flask-baffled-base-petg-with-vented-hdpe-closure/).  Made in India from medical-grade PETG (USP Class VI), these flasks have molded graduations, gamma sterilization, and a hydrophobic 0.2 µm PTFE vent cap (HDPE body). The baffled bottom design improves mixing and gas exchange. Each flask is individually wrapped; pack size is 24 per case.  **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.9 – An exact-match product from a known biotech plasticware manufacturer.  **Reason:** Specification (125 mL, PETG, sterile, vented, baffled) aligns fully; additional features (non-cytotoxic, autoclave rating “No”, -40–70°C range) suit bioprocess use.  **Concerns:** None significant; Tarsons is local to India, but international shipments may still be needed.  \n\n- **CellTreat (via Quality Biological)** – *CellTreat 125 mL Erlenmeyer Flask, Solid Cap, Plain Bottom, PETG, Sterile* – [Product Page](https://www.qualitybiological.com/product/125ml-erlenmeyer-flask-solid-cap-plain-bottom-petg-sterile/).  These single-use flasks are molded from medical-grade virgin PETG (reducing gas permeability), gamma-sterilized in individual bags. The plain-bottom flasks come with green HDPE solid screw caps (no vent). They are USP Class VI compliant and suitable for cell or microbial culture.  **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.8 – Exact 125 mL PETG sterile flask with a solid (non-vented) cap.  **Reason:** Matches query except closure type; reputable lab supplier.  **Concerns:** Only solid-cap version (no vent), and packaged 1 per bag (12 per case), which may differ from some vented-closure requests.  \n\n- **NEST Biotech (Genaxy)** – *NEST PETG Erlenmeyer Flask* – [Product Page](https://www.genaxy.com/products/details/213).  NEST offers 125 mL PETG shaker flasks in both baffled and plain bottoms. The caps come in seal (solid) or ventilated versions with 0.2 µm hydrophobic filters. They are E-beam sterilized (SAL 10^-6), non-pyrogenic, DNase/RNase free, individually shrink-wrapped, and graded.   **Confidence:** Medium. **Score:** 0.7 – Close equivalent produced by a recognized manufacturer (NEST Scientific).  **Reason:** The specs (125 mL, PETG, sterile, with vent/screw-cap options) match well.  **Concerns:** Lower brand recognition outside China, may require import and lead time; site indicates “Request a Quote.”  \n\n- **Eisco Labs** – *Eisco 125 mL Sterile PETG Erlenmeyer Flask, Vented, Flat Bottom (Pack of 1)* – [Product Page](https://www.eiscolabs.com/products/ch5238).  This lab-grade flask is gamma-irradiated (USP Class VI) PETG with a vented HDPE screw cap for sterile gas exchange. It is labeled for biopharma/cell culture use.  **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.9 – Direct match to requirement (125 mL PETG sterile, vented, flat-bottom).  **Reason:** Well-specified product from a known supplier.  **Concerns:** Sold as pack of 1 (single flask); unit price high if bulk purchases needed.  \n\nEach listed vendor provides an exact or near-exact 125 mL PETG Erlenmeyer flask suitable for cell/microbial culture.  All entries are sterile, non-cytotoxic, and shake-incubator compatible.  Ratings are based on match quality and vendor reliability; concerns note availability or packaging issues (e.g. some items are backordered or sold individually)."

            "raw_response": "- **Vendor: Mediray (New Zealand)** – *Irradiated Count-Tact 3P agar (CT3P) 100pcs – OT-43699*. Available on Mediray’s laboratory catalog, this is the BioMérieux‐brand triple-wrapped contact plates (100×55 mm) pre-poured with TSA for surface sampling. Confidence: **high (0.95)**. Recommendation Score: **0.95** – an exact product match (same brand and specifications) from a well-known distributor. Reason: Exact BioMérieux Count-Tact product in the specified pack size, with clear description and chart on the site. Concerns: Requires user login to see the price; shipping lead times from New Zealand to India may apply.\n\n- **Vendor: Dabos Online (Europe)** – *Pack of 10 Irradiated Contact Plates Media, BioMerieux – 43699, 100 plates, Irradiated Count-Tact 3P agar (Made-to-Order)*. This listing (at dabos.com) matches the BioMérieux 43699 product – 10 triple-bagged plate stacks (total 100 plates) of Count-Tact 3P TSA. Confidence: **high (0.90)**. Recommendation Score: **0.90** – an exact product match via a major laboratory supplier. Reason: Product name and details explicitly match the Count-Tact 43699 description, indicating correct item and manufacturer. Concerns: It is “made-to-order” so likely not immediately in stock; the site requires a commercial address or account to order and see pricing.\n\n- **Vendor: Thermo Fisher Scientific (Fisher Scientific)** – *Tryptone Soya Agar Irradiated Triple Wrap Contact Plate* (Product Code 11913732, 10 pcs/pkg). This is a 55 mm TSA contact plate, gamma-irradiated and triple-wrapped for sterile delivery (10 plates per pack). Confidence: **medium (0.80)**. Recommendation Score: **0.80** – a close equivalent (different brand) from a tier-1 vendor. Reason: The technology (triple-wrapped, sterile TSA contact plates) is functionally identical to Count-Tact 3P plates, and product specifications are similar. Concerns: Comes in packs of 10 (so ten packs are needed to get 100 plates); it’s a Thermo/Fisher-branded item (not Count-Tact brand). Availability is generally good on Fisher catalogs, but confirm lead time.\n\n- **Vendor: Thermo Fisher Scientific (Fisher Scientific)** – *Sabouraud Dextrose Agar Irradiated Triple Wrap Contact Plate (VHP Ind.) 100/Pk, 55 mm.* (Product Code 15486030). This offering is a 100-pack of 55 mm quadruple-wrapped Sabouraud agar contact plates with VHP indicator, matching the triple-pack style (designed for fungi). Confidence: **medium (0.70)**. Recommendation Score: **0.60** – provides exactly 100 plates triple-wrapped, but note brand and viability. Reason: The pack size (100) and protection level match the query, making it an exact-quantity alternative. Concerns: The site indicates this item is currently discontinued/unavailable; the brand is Thermo, not Count-Tact; and price/account info require login. It would need verification of restocking or alternatives.\n\n- **Vendor: Merck KGaA (MilliporeSigma)** – *Tryptic Soy Agar Ready-to-use Contact Plates, 55 mm, γ-irradiated, pack of 10 triple-wrapped (ISO/BAM/USP grade)*. (Product No. 1.46231). These are Millipore-branded TSA contact plates with neutralizers (ICR plate) triple-packed, 10 plates per box. Confidence: **medium (0.80)**. Recommendation Score: **0.80** – a solid equivalent alternative from a leading supplier. Reason: The product is a gamma-irradiated contact plate of similar formula and packaging (triple wrap) for environmental monitoring, comparable to Count-Tact TSA. Concerns: Only 10 plates per pack (so need 10 packs for 100 plates); different brand name (MilliporeSigma). Ordering may require contacting a sales rep or distributor for pricing and lead times."

Material is EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene) with 0.4 mm (16 mil) thickness, designed for repeated autoclave sterilization and strong resistance to hydrogen peroxide and other disinfectants ([www.ansell.com](https://www.ansell.com/int/en/products/alphatec-epdm-isolator-glove-85-502#:~:text=Port%20size%3A%20254mm%2F10%E2%80%9D%20Thickness%3A%200,suitable%20for%20disposal%20by%20incineration)) ([www.ansell.com](https://www.ansell.com/int/en/products/alphatec-epdm-isolator-glove-85-502#:~:text=,SHAPE%20Ambidextrous)). Ambidextrous, FDA 21 CFR 177 compliant and rated for chemical protection. (Vendor: Ansell, product URL: https://www.ansell.com/int/en/products/alphatec-epdm-isolator-glove-85-502)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Close match in length and use, thickness is 16 mil instead of 8 mil). *Recommendation: 0.75* – Ansell is a tier-1 PPE vendor; product is the correct EPDM material and length. *Reason:* Nearly all specifications match except the glove is thicker than requested. *Concerns:* Thicker glove may reduce dexterity. Availability is generally good for Ansell, but this specific model is non-sterile (for RABS/isolator use) and thicker than 8 mil.  \n\n- **Demaco Holland (Glovebox Supplies) – *EPDM glove, 8″ port, 15 mil, 32″ length*** – EPDM glove for glovebox port (Item 8E1532A0975). It is 32″ (800 mm) long, ambidextrous, hand size ≈9.75″, and 0.4 mm (15 mil) thick ([demaco-vacuum.com](https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/#:~:text=32%E2%80%B3%20long%20%28800mm%29%2CHand%20size%209,4)). Sold per glove (not a pair) as “Spare Glovebox Gloves” ([demaco-vacuum.com](https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/#:~:text=32%E2%80%B3%20long%20%28800mm%29%2CHand%20size%209,4)). (Vendor: Demaco; URL: https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Exact product specification except thickness). *Recommendation: 0.72* – Demaco is a reputable specialty glovebox supplier and this listing matches the material, port size, length, and user size exactly ([demaco-vacuum.com](https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/#:~:text=32%E2%80%B3%20long%20%28800mm%29%2CHand%20size%209,4)). *Reason:* EPDM, 32″ length, ambidextrous and FDA-compliant as required for pharma use. *Concerns:* Offered thickness is 15 mil vs requested 8 mil (double the thickness). Slight concern that Demaco sells per glove, and availability may require a minimum order or take 1 week delivery ([demaco-vacuum.com](https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/#:~:text=32%E2%80%B3%20long%20%28800mm%29%2CHand%20size%209,4mm%29%20thick)).  \n\n- **Albiox (Piercan) – *Isolator Glove EPDM black/white*** – Dual-layer EPDM (black outside, white lining) long isolator glove, halogen-free, powder-donned. Chemical-resistant (good vs H₂O₂, peracetic acid, etc.), UV/ozone resistant, FDA/CFR21-compliant ([albiox.com](https://albiox.com/product/epdm-black-epdm-white-isolator-glove/#:~:text=Black%20EPDM%20and%20White%20EPDM,on%20a%20secure%20connection%20ring)). Offered in two thickness grades: ~0.4 mm (16 mil) and ~0.6 mm (24 mil) ([albiox.com](https://albiox.com/product/epdm-black-epdm-white-isolator-glove/#:~:text=Thicknesses%3A)). It is typically 32″ in length (±20 mm tolerance) ([albiox.com](https://albiox.com/product/epdm-black-epdm-white-isolator-glove/#:~:text=,5%2F10)). Sold in packs of 10, lightly powdered ([albiox.com](https://albiox.com/product/epdm-black-epdm-white-isolator-glove/#:~:text=Packaging%20Individually%20packed%20in%20two,Pack%20of%2010%20units)). (Vendor: Albiox (distributor in Finland, global reach); Product URL: https://albiox.com/product/epdm-black-epdm-white-isolator-glove/)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Material and use match, but nominal thickness 16–24 mil). *Recommendation: 0.70* – Piercan (through Albiox) is a major glovebox glove maker (ISO certified). The two thickness options cover the needed EPDM type. *Reason:* Exact EPDM glove for isolator use; vendor is specialized and high-quality. *Concerns:* Thinner available version is still 16 mil (vs requested 8 mil). Pack and lot requirements (min 10) and sterilization status (sold sterile, etc.) must be clarified. Possibly longer lead time due to specialty product.  \n\n- **GloveBoxGloves (UK) – *EPDM Gauntlets & Sleeves*** – EPDM long sleeves (gloves) designed for glovebox and lab use. Made of EPDM with 0.4 mm (15 mil) thickness and provided 800 mm (31.5″) overall length ([gloveboxgloves.co.uk](https://gloveboxgloves.co.uk/product/edpm-gaunlets-and-sleeves/#:~:text=Colour%3A%20Black%20Port%20Sizes%20Diameter%3A%C2%A0203mm,4F%20to%20266F)). Available with cuff and O-ring fittings; smooth texture, antistatic, UV-resistant ([gloveboxgloves.co.uk](https://gloveboxgloves.co.uk/product/edpm-gaunlets-and-sleeves/#:~:text=%2A%20Manufactured%20from%20EPDM%2C%20Ethylene,UV%20Resistant)). The product listing (SKU G-EDP) describes 32″ gloves with hand size 9 and 8″/10″ port compatibility ([gloveboxgloves.co.uk](https://gloveboxgloves.co.uk/product/edpm-gaunlets-and-sleeves/#:~:text=Specification)). (Vendor: GloveBoxGloves, UK; URL: https://gloveboxgloves.co.uk/product/edpm-gaunlets-and-sleeves/)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Excellent match on length and material, slightly thicker). *Recommendation: 0.72* – Specialist glovebox supplier and global shipping available. *Reason:* Direct EPDM glove product with correct dimensions (close) and explicitly intended for lab/pharma glovebox use. *Concerns:* Thickness is 15 mil instead of 8 mil, and only hand size 9 listed. No explicit sterility certification mentioned. Stock status should be confirmed.  \n\n- **Glove Box Australia – *EPDM GLOVE – 8.5 – 4/10 – 800 – Ø156*** – Ambidextrous EPDM black glove (Piercan brand), hand size 8.5 (9″), 0.4 mm (15 mil) thick, 800 mm long ([www.labhub.au](https://www.labhub.au/products/epdm-glove-8-5-4-10-800mm-o156?Title=Default+Title#:~:text=Suitable%20for%20every%20glove%20box,manufacturers)). Designed for 156 mm (6.14″) glove port (part “4/10” indicates the port), FDA-food-contact compliant with high chemical resistance ([www.labhub.au](https://www.labhub.au/products/epdm-glove-8-5-4-10-800mm-o156?Title=Default+Title#:~:text=Black%20EPDM%20,2600)). Sold by the glove; MOQ 20 gloves. (Vendor: Glove Box Australia; URL: https://www.gloveboxaustralia.com.au/products/epdm-glove-8-5-4-10-800mm-o156)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Correct length and EPDM; thickness mismatch). *Recommendation: 0.70* – Reputable supplier in Asia-Pacific (sources Piercan gloves). Exact match of EPDM long glove (31.5″, size 8.5). *Reason:* Close spec and clear vendor specialization. *Concerns:* Only one thickness offered (0.4 mm). MOQ of 20 indicates bulk ordering; ensure availability.  \n\n- **Tarun Gloves (India) – *EPDM Isolator Gloves*** – EPDM heavyweight glove for gloveboxes. (Site only shows a general “EPDM Gloves” offering in “Isolator Gloves” category). Vendor claims EPDM material suitable for pharmaceutical environments ([www.tarungloves.com](https://www.tarungloves.com/isolator-gloves.html#:~:text=Color%20%20)). (Vendor: Tarun Gloves, India; URL: https://www.tarungloves.com/isolator-gloves.html)  \n  *Confidence: Low* (Vague details; no length or thickness given). *Recommendation: 0.50* – Indian manufacturer with EPDM chemical gloves. *Reason:* Material matches query (EPDM), and local presence could offer competitive pricing. *Concerns:* Lacks product specification (length, thickness not listed). Quality and certifications (FDA, ISO) are uncertain. Likely need to verify actual glove parameters and minimum order quantities."

        "raw_response": "1. **Cole-Parmer (Contec brand)** – *Contec EasySat™ Bucketless Floor Mop Head (Smooth); 32/Pk* – [Product page](https://www.coleparmer.com/i/contec-easysat-mop-head-for-bucketless-floor-mop-smooth-32-pk/0941131) – This is the Contec EasySat™ mop head (smooth, angled) designed for use with the Contec bucketless mop system. It is made of ultraclean polyester/ester foam (VertiKlean) and is autoclavable. It attaches via hook-and-loop to the EasySat handle and eliminates the need for a mop bucket. Comes non-sterile, pack of 32. **Confidence:** High. **Rec. Score:** 0.95 – Exact Contec product, from a reputable distributor. **Reason:** Exact match to bucketless pharmaceutical mop head; user-oriented vendor site. **Concerns:** Sold in UK currency; verify shipping to India; Non-sterile (sterile gamma-irradiated version available separately).\n\n2. **Foamtec (PharmaMOP)** – *Foamtec PharmaMOP™ Cleanroom Mop Heads, Sterile* – [Product page](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/pharmamop-cleanroom-mop-heads-sterile/19304821) – This sterile mop head is part of Foamtec’s PharmaMOP system (high-capacity, drip-resistant design). It features a 0.125″ foam core with ultrapure polyester cover (gamma-irradiated, SAL 10⁻⁶) for heavy-duty disinfectant cleaning. Suitable for ISO 5-7 cleanrooms, compatible with bleach, IPA, etc. (Other styles include non-sterile and textured versions under same catalog). **Confidence:** Medium-High. **Rec. Score:** 0.80 – Good match in concept (drip-resistant, ergonomic handle system) and manufacturer. **Reason:** PharmaMOP is designed for aseptic processing areas and meets cleanroom standards; sold through Fisher Sci. **Concerns:** Not explicitly “bucketless” handle (requires manipulating scrubber), but described as “drip-resistant, no wringer”. Ensure it fits the internal-dispense handle system. Pricing and availability need checking.\n\n3. **SterileMate** – *EasyFlo™ Bucketless Mop System* – [Product page](https://sterilemate.com/product/easyflo-bucketless-mop-system/) – SterileMate’s EasyFlo is a bucketless floor mop system with a built-in reservoir (28 oz.) and palm-trigger dispensing. The site lists a starter kit (handle, tank, 18″ frame, 2 flat microfiber pads) and replacement handles. The mop covers up to ~3000 ft², with a lightweight aluminum frame. Kits include 18″ flat wet mop pads (sold separately). **Confidence:** Medium. **Rec. Score:** 0.65 – Close match, intended for clean/sterile areas. **Reason:** Explicitly bucketless design, marketed for sterile environments. **Concerns:** Smaller capacity (28 oz vs 52 oz), not explicitly ISO-certified; primarily shows system overview, less technical detail. Availability and India shipping must be verified.\n\n4. **Hillyard/Boardwalk** – *Boardwalk Bucketless Microfiber Mop System, 18″ W, Blue* – [Product page](https://www.hillyard.com/Wet-Mops/Boardwalk-Bucketless-Microfiber-Mop-System-18-W-Blue/p/BWKBWMS16MFM) – A general-purpose bucketless mop kit with a 865 mL internal tank and 18″ wide microfiber pad. The design dispenses solution directly to the mop head’s high-weight microfiber pad. Marketed for efficiency (saves water/chemicals, reduces contamination). **Confidence:** Low-Medium. **Rec. Score:** 0.50 – Fair match (true bucketless concept) but not specifically “pharmaceutical grade”. **Reason:** Well-known janitorial brand (Boardwalk) selling a bucketless system, so conceptually fits. **Concerns:** No claims of cleanroom/GMP compliance or certification; not gamma-sterilizable; likely not validated for particle/contamination control in pharma settings.\n\n5. **Biomed Pharmacare (India)** – *Bucketless Mopping System for Pharma Use* – [Product page](https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/bucketless-mopping-system-for-pharma-use-20635866191.html) – An Indian-made mop system described as “bucketless” for pharmaceutical use. Features a plastic handle and looped-end microfiber mop head (red) with no separate bucket. **Confidence:** Low. **Rec. Score:** 0.35 – Loose match. **Reason:** Claims to be bucketless and intended for pharma, and is an India-based manufacturer (potential for local procurement). **Concerns:** Product details are minimal (IndiaMART listing only). “Dry mop” suggests it may not involve dispensing liquids. No information on cleanroom certification or compliance; quality and applicability are unclear. Highest caution on fit for critical environments."
