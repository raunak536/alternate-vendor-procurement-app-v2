Quantitative immunoassay (96-well plate) for measuring hyaluronidase activity in biological samples (validated for human serum, plasma, urine, etc.). HA substrate is pre-coated in each well to quantify activity.  \n  **Confidence:** High  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.9 – *Exact product match from a reputable distributor (uses Echelon’s K-6000 code).*  \n  **Reason:** This listing is the same Echelon kit (K-6000) in the required format, with full specifications matching the query. 2BScientific is a known supplier of research kits.  \n  **Concerns:** Region restrictions (ordered from EU, not listed outside UK/EU) and availability (“Not available in your region” flag suggests ordering limitations).  \n\n- **Vendor:** MoBiTec/BioZol (Germany)  \n  **Product:** Hyaluronidase Activity ELISA (Echelon Biosciences kit, Cat# ECH-K-6000, 96-well)  \n  **URL:** https://www.mobitec.com/products/lipidomics/kits-assays/ech-k-6000-1x96wells-kit/hyaluronidase-activity-elisa-echelon-product-code-k-6000-1x96wells-kit  \n  **Description:** Direct Echelon Biosciences kit listing. 96-well ELISA measuring hyaluronidase enzyme activity (uses HA substrate in wells). Validated for human sera, plasma, urine, and includes purified bovine hyaluronidase. Storage at –20°C.  \n  **Confidence:** High  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.9 – *Exact Echelon product offered by a major European distributor.*  \n  **Reason:** The product description and supplier (Echelon) exactly match the query. MoBiTec (BioZol) is a reliable supplier in Europe.  \n  **Concerns:** Shipping/storage (requires dry ice, –20°C) and regional availability (not sold in France/Italy, per site notes).  \n\n- **Vendor:** Tebu-bio (Europe)  \n  **Product:** Hyaluronidase Activity ELISA – Kit (Echelon Biosciences, Cat# K-6000, 96T)  \n  **URL:** https://www.tebubio.com/en_fr_eur/hyaluronidase-activity-elisa-117k-6000-kit.html  \n  **Description:** Echelon Biosciences Hyaluronidase Activity ELISA kit (K-6000) sold by Tebu-bio. Same quantitative immunoassay format (96-well plate) for HA-degrading enzyme activity. Listed price and details, shipping on dry ice, storage –20°C.  \n  **Confidence:** High  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.9 – *Exact kit from Echelon, sold by an established supplier (Tebu-bio).*  \n  **Reason:** Product page confirms catalog number K-6000 and Echelon Biosciences as manufacturer. Meets all specified criteria (format, assay type, sample compatibility).  \n  **Concerns:** European supplier (shipment to India may have lead time); relatively high price.  \n\n- **Vendor:** Amsbio (UK/US/CH)  \n  **Product:** Hyaluronidase Assay Kit (“RAZIE” Assay, Kit Ra003-01-HAK)  \n  **URL:** https://www.amsbio.com/hyaluronidase-assay-kit-ra003-01-hak  \n  **Description:** Enzyme activity assay measuring mammalian hyaluronidase by substrate degradation (RAZIE technology). Provides quantitative activity data (used for inhibitor screening or enzyme quantification). Kit includes PRO-enzymatic reagents, uses 96-well plate. Note: this is an activity assay (not immuno-ELISA).  \n  **Confidence:** Medium  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.7 – *Close equivalent measuring hyaluronidase activity (different format).*  \n  **Reason:** Although not an ELISA, Amsbio’s kit addresses the same need (reports hyaluronidase activity) and is made by a respected enzyme kit manufacturer. Useful if the exact ELISA format is not mandatory.  \n  **Concerns:** Uses a different assay method (RAZIE) instead of immunoassay; likely higher cost ($1715); may require different instrumentation.  \n\n- **Vendor:** Biorbyt (UK)  \n  **Product:** Hyaluronidase Enzymatic Assay Kit (Catalog ORB608267, 96 assays)  \n  **URL:** https://www.biorbyt.com/hyaluronidase-enzymatic-assay-orb608267.html  \n  **Description:** Chromogenic enzymatic assay (96-well format) for hyaluronidase activity. Reported range ~28–896 U/mL, sensitivity ~2 U/mL. Targets cell culture supernatants and other samples. Measures turbidity; results read on standard plate reader.  \n  **Confidence:** Medium  \n  **Recommendation Score:** 0.6 – *Acceptable activity assay alternative.*  \n  **Reason:** The kit measures hyaluronidase activity quantitatively, although by detecting reaction products (turbidity) rather than an ELISA. It is a complete 96-well kit from a known supplier (Biorbyt) with validated range/sensitivity.  \n  **Concerns:** Not an immunoassay; performance and sample compatibility (pharmaceutical prep, cell supernatant only specified) differ from intended use. Documentation/availability details limited on site.  \n\n"

Verified product page shows a quantitative ELISA for hyaluronidase activity in human serum, plasma, urine, etc., matching the query (sample volume ~12 µL, assay time ~2.5 h)【84†】.  **Confidence:** High (exact product/code match).  **URL Verified:** Yes (MoBiTec product page).  **Recommendation Score:** 0.95 – Exact match from a specialized, ISO-certified enzyme assay supplier (Echelon); widely used in research.  **Reason:** Tier-1 supplier for lipid and glycan assays; exact kit (K-6000) as requested.  **Concerns:** Pack size is single 96-well kit (original query sought 5×96 plates, but multiples can be ordered). Supply from MoBiTec/Biozol (Germany) is reliable; lead time typical for custom reagent.\n\n**Bio-Techne (R&D Systems)** – *Human Hyaluronidase 1 (HYAL1) DuoSet ELISA (Catalog #DY7358)*【27†】.  This sandwich ELISA kit measures HYAL1 protein in human samples; while it detects enzyme amount (not direct activity), it’s a close functional assay for hyaluronidase.  **Confidence:** Medium (high-quality global company, but kit measures protein concentration rather than activity).  **URL Verified:** Yes (R&D Systems product page).  **Recommendation Score:** 0.88 – Excellent technical match from a top-tier manufacturer.  **Reason:** R&D/Bio-Techne is a leading ELISA provider (ISO/FDA certified); DuoSet supplies validated antibody pairs for HYAL1 with sensitivity ~0.1–10 ng/mL.  **Concerns:** Not an “activity” assay per se; measures enzyme quantity. Lead time subject to distributor stock. \n\n**Biomatik (Elabscience)** – *Human Hyaluronidase (HAase) ELISA Kit, Cat# EKN45960-96T*【37†】.  A colorimetric sandwich ELISA for human hyaluronidase (HAase) in serum, plasma, tissue homogenates. Detection range 0.312–20 ng/mL【88†】. **Confidence:** Medium (reputable kit supplier with global presence).  **URL Verified:** Yes (Biomatik product page).  **Recommendation Score:** 0.80 – Strong alternative ELISA from a known biotech company.  **Reason:** Kit specifically targets hyaluronidase; published with validation.  **Concerns:** Kit measures concentration not activity. Kit size is 96 tests (fits query scale). Manufacturer (Biomatik, Canada) is established (ISO 9001). Check stock/lead time on order.\n\n**Enzo Life Sciences** – *Dog/Canine Hyaluronidase HAase ELISA Kit (Cat# NOV-BG-CAN11273)*【76†】【89†】.  A sandwich ELISA for canine hyaluronidase; potential cross-reactivity with other species is unclear. **Confidence:** Low-Medium (top-tier biomedical supplier, but species is canine).  **URL Verified:** Yes (Enzo product page).  **Recommendation Score:** 0.65 – Acceptable alternate ELISA vendor (global, high quality), though not human-specific.  **Reason:** Enzo is ISO/FDA-certified; kit format is validated ELISA.  **Concerns:** Intended for dog samples; human reactivity not guaranteed. Consult tech support for cross-reactivity. If animal models are acceptable, can be used; otherwise lower priority.\n\n**Merck / MilliporeSigma** – *Hyaluronidase Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit (Cat# MAK458, 100 tests)*【42†】【90†】.  A turbidimetric enzyme activity assay (not Immunoassay): measures hyaluronidase activity by HA degradation (A600 nm readout). **Confidence:** Low (differs from “ELISA”, but directly measures activity).  **URL Verified:** Yes (MilliporeSigma product page).  **Recommendation Score:** 0.50 – Last-resort alternative from a top-tier supplier.  **Reason:** Merck is globally reputable (cGMP, ISO approved). Kit directly quantifies hyaluronidase activity, although via turbidity.  **Concerns:** Non-ELISA format, possible interference by serum turbidity; designed for inhibitor screening (protocol differs). Kit bulk (100 tests) may be oversized; check applicability. Limited shelf life for enzyme reagents.\n\n"

            "raw_response": "**Echelon Biosciences (USA)** – *Hyaluronidase Activity ELISA Kit* (Cat. K-6000, 5×96-well plates).  This is a quantitative immunoassay for measuring active hyaluronidase in human serum, plasma, urine or purified enzyme.  The product page on Fisher Scientific (authorized distributor) explicitly lists the “Hyaluronidase Activity ELISA” from Echelon (Catalogue K6000KIT, sufficient for 15 plates of assays) ([www.fishersci.com](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/hyaluronidase-activity-elisa/NC1807465#:~:text=The%20Hyaluronidase%20Activity%20ELISA%20is,HA%20This%20item%20is%20non)) ([www.mobitec.com](https://www.mobitec.com/products/lipidomics/kits-assays/ech-k-6000-1x96wells-kit/hyaluronidase-activity-elisa-echelon-product-code-k-6000-1x96wells-kit#:~:text=Description%3A%20%20,the%20hyaluronidase%20is%20determined%20by)).  This matches the requested kit.  **URL verified:** Yes (Fisher page loads correctly).  **Confidence:** High (0.9) – Echelon is the original manufacturer of this kit and is a reputable US biotech supplier.  **Recommendation score:** 0.9.  *Reason:* Tier-1 specialty reagents company; kit specs (activity assay format, validated sample types) align exactly.  *Concerns:* None major; the kit is well-documented though note Fisher page says “non-returnable” (typical for temperature-sensitive kits).  \n\n**Bio-Techne (R&D Systems, USA)** – *Human Hyaluronidase 1 (HYAL1) DuoSet ELISA* (Cat. DY7358).  This is a sandwich ELISA kit to measure human HYAL1 enzyme levels (not explicitly labeled “activity,” but it is a HYAL1-specific ELISA kit) ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/p/elisa-kits/human-hyaluronidase-1-hyal1-duoset-elisa_dy7358#:~:text=)) ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/p/elisa-kits/human-hyaluronidase-1-hyal1-duoset-elisa_dy7358#:~:text=Product%20Summary%20for%20Human%20Hyaluronidase,1%2FHYAL1%20DuoSet%20ELISA)).  The official Bio-Techne (R&D Systems) site provides details on this kit (assay range 12.5–800 pg/mL, sample types serum/plasma/cell culture) ([www.bio-techne.com](https://www.bio-techne.com/p/elisa-kits/human-hyaluronidase-1-hyal1-duoset-elisa_dy7358#:~:text=)).  **URL verified:** Yes (Bio-Techne product page loads).  **Confidence:** High (0.8) – Bio-Techne (R&D Systems) is a leading global supplier with ISO certification, and this kit is an established commercial product.  **Recommendation score:** 0.8.  *Reason:* Well-known brand with high-quality ELISAs; product covers quantitation of human hyaluronidase (HYAL1) and  fits as a close equivalent.  *Concerns:* It is a “DuoSet” development kit (requires separate plate purchase) and measures enzyme concentration rather than enzyme *activity*, but otherwise is a strong alternative.  \n\n**Cloud-Clone Corp. (China)** – *ELISA Kit for Hyaluronidase (HAase), Human* (Cat. SEB217Hu).  This kit (96T or 5×96T format) is a sandwich ELISA for human hyaluronidase (HAase), with sensitivity ~0.121 ng/mL and range 0.312–20 ng/mL ([www.cloud-clone.com](http://www.cloud-clone.com/products/SEB217Hu.html#:~:text=ELISA%20Kit%20for%20Hyaluronidase%20)) ([www.cloud-clone.com](http://www.cloud-clone.com/products/SEB217Hu.html#:~:text=,2993%C2%A0%20US%24%205653%C2%A0%20US%24%2046550)).  It explicitly lists “Sample Type: serum, plasma, tissue homogenates” ([www.cloud-clone.com](http://www.cloud-clone.com/products/SEB217Hu.html#:~:text=,DownloadInstruction%20Manual)).  **URL verified:** Yes (Cloud-Clone product page loads).  **Confidence:** High (0.7) – Cloud-Clone is a large ISO-certified biotech firm known for immunoassay kits.  **Recommendation score:** 0.7.  *Reason:* Kit specs (assay format, sample compatibility) are very similar to the query.  *Concerns:* Mostly that it is a Chinese supplier (though globally distributed); documentation is complete but quality is perceived as tier-2.  \n\n**CUSABIO (China/USA)** – *Human Hyaluronidase-1 (HYAL1) ELISA Kit* (Cat. CSB-EL010918HU).  This is a 96T (5×96T available) colorimetric ELISA for human HYAL1, sold in standard kit format ([www.cusabio.com](https://www.cusabio.com/ELISA-Kit/Human-Hyaluronidase-1HYAL1-ELISA-kit-83645.html#:~:text=Code%20%20%7C%20CSB,Please%20leave%20a%20message%20below)).  It comes with ISO lab protocol and can be purchased in the requested 5×96-well format.  **URL verified:** Yes (CUSABIO product page loads).  **Confidence:** Medium (0.6–0.7) – CUSABIO is a manufacturer of many ELISA kits with international presence.  **Recommendation score:** 0.7.  *Reason:* Established supplier in immunoassays; product details match a hyaluronidase ELISA.  *Concerns:* The kit measures HYAL1 protein levels rather than “activity,” and CUSABIO is a second-tier manufacturer (though with ISO certification).  \n\n**Abbexa Ltd (UK)** – *Human Hyaluronidase (HAase) ELISA Kit* (Cat. abx350613).  This sandwich ELISA kit quantifies human hyaluronidase in serum, plasma or tissue samples ([www.abbexa.com](https://www.abbexa.com/human-hyaluronidase-elisa-kit-1#:~:text=Human%20Hyaluronidase%20,kit%20according%20to%20the%20storage)). It is sold in 96T, 5×96T and 10×96T pack sizes ([www.abbexa.com](https://www.abbexa.com/human-hyaluronidase-elisa-kit-1#:~:text=Human%20Hyaluronidase%20,kit%20according%20to%20the%20storage)).  **URL verified:** Yes (Abbexa product page loads partially, showing the kit details).  **Confidence:** Medium (0.5–0.6) – Abbexa is a smaller UK biotech supplier.  **Recommendation score:** 0.6.  *Reason:* Product matches the query (target analyte and format) and comes in 5×96 format.  *Concerns:* Lesser-known manufacturer with limited global track record; documentation is available but less extensive (site requires JS).  The kit appears intended for research use (no mention of regulatory approvals).  \n\nOverall, these five manufacturers provide ELISA kits for hyaluronidase that closely match the requested specifications. Echelon and Bio-Techne (R&D Systems) are top-tier suppliers with well-established quality systems, followed by Cloud-Clone Corp. and CUSABIO which are large global biotech companies, and Abbexa as a smaller specialized supplier. All URLs above have been verified to load the specific product page. Recommendation levels range from 0.6 (Abbexa) to 0.9 (Echelon) based on match quality and supplier reputation.  \n\n"

        "raw_response": "- **Sigma-Aldrich (Merck)** – *Nalgene® sterile, single-use Erlenmeyer flask with vented closure (PETG, 125 mL, case of 24 ea)* – [Product Page](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/KR/en/product/sigma/tmo41150125).  These flasks are made of medical-grade PETG (XD resin) and come gamma-sterilized with a 0.2 µm vented HDPE screw cap for sterile gas exchange.  They are graduated, non-cytotoxic, USP Class VI compliant and suitable for shaking incubators.  **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.9 – Exact match from a tier-1 supplier (Merck Sigma/Nalgene) with confirmed specs.  **Reason:** Meets all requirements (vented PETG, 125 mL, sterile, shaker-compatible).  **Concerns:** Currently “Contact Customer Service for Availability” on the site (likely backordered), and regional site required inquiry.      \n\n- **Thermo Fisher Scientific (Nalgene)** – *Nalgene™ Single-Use PETG Erlenmeyer Flask with Plain Bottom (125 mL, sterile)* – [Product Page](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4115-0125).  This is the standard Nalgene PETG flask (plain flat bottom) sold as a pack of sterile flasks, vented (38×430 mm caps) or non-vented variants. It’s made from USP-grade PETG, gamma-irradiated, and available with hydrophobic vent caps or solid caps. **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.9 – Exact product match from the primary manufacturer.  **Reason:** Nalgene is highly reputable; catalog lists 125 mL vented (4115-0125) and non-vented (4112-0125) options with identical specs.  **Concerns:** Listing shows “Available Soon – part #: 4115-0125” and “Contact for Availability,” indicating possible backorder.  \n\n- **Tarsons (India)** – *Sterile Erlenmeyer Cell Culture Flask, Baffled base, PETG with Vented HDPE closure (125 mL)* – [Product Page](https://www.tarsons.com/product/sterile-erlenmeyer-cell-culture-flask-baffled-base-petg-with-vented-hdpe-closure/).  Made in India from medical-grade PETG (USP Class VI), these flasks have molded graduations, gamma sterilization, and a hydrophobic 0.2 µm PTFE vent cap (HDPE body). The baffled bottom design improves mixing and gas exchange. Each flask is individually wrapped; pack size is 24 per case.  **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.9 – An exact-match product from a known biotech plasticware manufacturer.  **Reason:** Specification (125 mL, PETG, sterile, vented, baffled) aligns fully; additional features (non-cytotoxic, autoclave rating “No”, -40–70°C range) suit bioprocess use.  **Concerns:** None significant; Tarsons is local to India, but international shipments may still be needed.  \n\n- **CellTreat (via Quality Biological)** – *CellTreat 125 mL Erlenmeyer Flask, Solid Cap, Plain Bottom, PETG, Sterile* – [Product Page](https://www.qualitybiological.com/product/125ml-erlenmeyer-flask-solid-cap-plain-bottom-petg-sterile/).  These single-use flasks are molded from medical-grade virgin PETG (reducing gas permeability), gamma-sterilized in individual bags. The plain-bottom flasks come with green HDPE solid screw caps (no vent). They are USP Class VI compliant and suitable for cell or microbial culture.  **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.8 – Exact 125 mL PETG sterile flask with a solid (non-vented) cap.  **Reason:** Matches query except closure type; reputable lab supplier.  **Concerns:** Only solid-cap version (no vent), and packaged 1 per bag (12 per case), which may differ from some vented-closure requests.  \n\n- **NEST Biotech (Genaxy)** – *NEST PETG Erlenmeyer Flask* – [Product Page](https://www.genaxy.com/products/details/213).  NEST offers 125 mL PETG shaker flasks in both baffled and plain bottoms. The caps come in seal (solid) or ventilated versions with 0.2 µm hydrophobic filters. They are E-beam sterilized (SAL 10^-6), non-pyrogenic, DNase/RNase free, individually shrink-wrapped, and graded.   **Confidence:** Medium. **Score:** 0.7 – Close equivalent produced by a recognized manufacturer (NEST Scientific).  **Reason:** The specs (125 mL, PETG, sterile, with vent/screw-cap options) match well.  **Concerns:** Lower brand recognition outside China, may require import and lead time; site indicates “Request a Quote.”  \n\n- **Eisco Labs** – *Eisco 125 mL Sterile PETG Erlenmeyer Flask, Vented, Flat Bottom (Pack of 1)* – [Product Page](https://www.eiscolabs.com/products/ch5238).  This lab-grade flask is gamma-irradiated (USP Class VI) PETG with a vented HDPE screw cap for sterile gas exchange. It is labeled for biopharma/cell culture use.  **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.9 – Direct match to requirement (125 mL PETG sterile, vented, flat-bottom).  **Reason:** Well-specified product from a known supplier.  **Concerns:** Sold as pack of 1 (single flask); unit price high if bulk purchases needed.  \n\nEach listed vendor provides an exact or near-exact 125 mL PETG Erlenmeyer flask suitable for cell/microbial culture.  All entries are sterile, non-cytotoxic, and shake-incubator compatible.  Ratings are based on match quality and vendor reliability; concerns note availability or packaging issues (e.g. some items are backordered or sold individually)."

            "raw_response": "- **Vendor: Mediray (New Zealand)** – *Irradiated Count-Tact 3P agar (CT3P) 100pcs – OT-43699*. Available on Mediray’s laboratory catalog, this is the BioMérieux‐brand triple-wrapped contact plates (100×55 mm) pre-poured with TSA for surface sampling. Confidence: **high (0.95)**. Recommendation Score: **0.95** – an exact product match (same brand and specifications) from a well-known distributor. Reason: Exact BioMérieux Count-Tact product in the specified pack size, with clear description and chart on the site. Concerns: Requires user login to see the price; shipping lead times from New Zealand to India may apply.\n\n- **Vendor: Dabos Online (Europe)** – *Pack of 10 Irradiated Contact Plates Media, BioMerieux – 43699, 100 plates, Irradiated Count-Tact 3P agar (Made-to-Order)*. This listing (at dabos.com) matches the BioMérieux 43699 product – 10 triple-bagged plate stacks (total 100 plates) of Count-Tact 3P TSA. Confidence: **high (0.90)**. Recommendation Score: **0.90** – an exact product match via a major laboratory supplier. Reason: Product name and details explicitly match the Count-Tact 43699 description, indicating correct item and manufacturer. Concerns: It is “made-to-order” so likely not immediately in stock; the site requires a commercial address or account to order and see pricing.\n\n- **Vendor: Thermo Fisher Scientific (Fisher Scientific)** – *Tryptone Soya Agar Irradiated Triple Wrap Contact Plate* (Product Code 11913732, 10 pcs/pkg). This is a 55 mm TSA contact plate, gamma-irradiated and triple-wrapped for sterile delivery (10 plates per pack). Confidence: **medium (0.80)**. Recommendation Score: **0.80** – a close equivalent (different brand) from a tier-1 vendor. Reason: The technology (triple-wrapped, sterile TSA contact plates) is functionally identical to Count-Tact 3P plates, and product specifications are similar. Concerns: Comes in packs of 10 (so ten packs are needed to get 100 plates); it’s a Thermo/Fisher-branded item (not Count-Tact brand). Availability is generally good on Fisher catalogs, but confirm lead time.\n\n- **Vendor: Thermo Fisher Scientific (Fisher Scientific)** – *Sabouraud Dextrose Agar Irradiated Triple Wrap Contact Plate (VHP Ind.) 100/Pk, 55 mm.* (Product Code 15486030). This offering is a 100-pack of 55 mm quadruple-wrapped Sabouraud agar contact plates with VHP indicator, matching the triple-pack style (designed for fungi). Confidence: **medium (0.70)**. Recommendation Score: **0.60** – provides exactly 100 plates triple-wrapped, but note brand and viability. Reason: The pack size (100) and protection level match the query, making it an exact-quantity alternative. Concerns: The site indicates this item is currently discontinued/unavailable; the brand is Thermo, not Count-Tact; and price/account info require login. It would need verification of restocking or alternatives.\n\n- **Vendor: Merck KGaA (MilliporeSigma)** – *Tryptic Soy Agar Ready-to-use Contact Plates, 55 mm, γ-irradiated, pack of 10 triple-wrapped (ISO/BAM/USP grade)*. (Product No. 1.46231). These are Millipore-branded TSA contact plates with neutralizers (ICR plate) triple-packed, 10 plates per box. Confidence: **medium (0.80)**. Recommendation Score: **0.80** – a solid equivalent alternative from a leading supplier. Reason: The product is a gamma-irradiated contact plate of similar formula and packaging (triple wrap) for environmental monitoring, comparable to Count-Tact TSA. Concerns: Only 10 plates per pack (so need 10 packs for 100 plates); different brand name (MilliporeSigma). Ordering may require contacting a sales rep or distributor for pricing and lead times."

Confidence: **High** (clear triple-wrapped irradiated contact plate from a leading supplier). URL Verified: page loads correctly. Rec Score: **0.95**. Reason: Tier-1 manufacturer (Oxoid brand) with exactly the triple-wrapped irradiated plate format needed. Concern: Packaging name uses “Triple Wrap” rather than “3P”, but functionally equivalent.  \n- **Southern Group Laboratory (SGL)** – *Plate Count Agar, Contact Plate, Irradiated* (https://www.sglab.com/product/plate-count-agar-contact-plate-irradiated/) – A 55 mm irradiated, gas-impermeable (triple-wrapped) PDA/TSA contact plate for environmental monitoring. Confidence: **High** (specialized irradiated contact plate matching description). URL Verified: page confirmed. Rec Score: **0.85**. Reason: Established biopharma media supplier in India, produces pre-poured gamma-irradiated plates. Concern: SGL is a regional manufacturer (though reputable); availability outside India might need validation.  \n- **Becton, Dickinson and Co. (BD)** – *BD BBL™ Isolator Pack Plated Media* (https://www.bd.com/en-us/products-and-solutions/products/product-families/bd-bbl-isolator-pack-plated-media) – A product line of contact plates (e.g. RODAC and TSA/Lecithin-Polysorbate media) supplied in gamma-irradiated isolator packs. Confidence: **Medium-High** (BD’s official “Isolator Pack” lineup includes triple-wrapped sterile plates). URL Verified: page loads (category overview). Rec Score: **0.90**. Reason: Global tier-1 brand; the product family explicitly mentions “gamma-irradiated packs” for isolator use. Concern: This is a family page (no specific SKU listed) and may require contacting BD rep for exact code/packs.  \n- **CPC Biotech** – *MCTA (TSA+Lec+Tw80) 55 mm TWSI* (https://www.cpcbiotech.it/en/microbial-content-test-agar-tsalectw80/) – A TSA contact plate with lecithin and Tween-80 (neutralizers) in a triple-wrapped sterile irradiated format (55 mm). Confidence: **Medium** (manufacturer page for irradiated contact medium). URL Verified. Rec Score: **0.80**. Reason: Recognized European producer of GMP pre-poured media; this item is listed under “Irradiated Plates” (TWSI likely denotes triple wrap sterile irradiated). Concern: Product name doesn’t explicitly say “3P” or “Irradiated” in the title (reliance on page context).  \n- **HiMedia (Himedia Laboratories)** – *R2A Agar Plate (Lockable plate) (γ-irradiated)(Triple pack)* (https://www.himedialabs.com/us/mp962lgt-r2a-agar-plate-lockable-plate-g-irradiatedtriple-pack.html) – A 55 mm R2A agar contact plate with locking lid, gamma-irradiated and triple-wrapped for cleanroom use. Confidence: **High** (page title explicitly “γ-irradiated (Triple pack)”). URL Verified. Rec Score: **0.80**. Reason: Established global media company; triple-wrapped irradiated format clearly given. Concern: R2A medium is for heterotrophic count (different from TSA) but still suitable for environmental cell counts as an equivalent product."

        "raw_response": "- **Ansell – *AlphaTec® EPDM Isolator Gloves 85-502*** – Non-sterile dual-colored black/white EPDM isolator gloves with extended (32″/800 mm) length. Material is EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene) with 0.4 mm (16 mil) thickness, designed for repeated autoclave sterilization and strong resistance to hydrogen peroxide and other disinfectants ([www.ansell.com](https://www.ansell.com/int/en/products/alphatec-epdm-isolator-glove-85-502#:~:text=Port%20size%3A%20254mm%2F10%E2%80%9D%20Thickness%3A%200,suitable%20for%20disposal%20by%20incineration)) ([www.ansell.com](https://www.ansell.com/int/en/products/alphatec-epdm-isolator-glove-85-502#:~:text=,SHAPE%20Ambidextrous)). Ambidextrous, FDA 21 CFR 177 compliant and rated for chemical protection. (Vendor: Ansell, product URL: https://www.ansell.com/int/en/products/alphatec-epdm-isolator-glove-85-502)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Close match in length and use, thickness is 16 mil instead of 8 mil). *Recommendation: 0.75* – Ansell is a tier-1 PPE vendor; product is the correct EPDM material and length. *Reason:* Nearly all specifications match except the glove is thicker than requested. *Concerns:* Thicker glove may reduce dexterity. Availability is generally good for Ansell, but this specific model is non-sterile (for RABS/isolator use) and thicker than 8 mil.  \n\n- **Demaco Holland (Glovebox Supplies) – *EPDM glove, 8″ port, 15 mil, 32″ length*** – EPDM glove for glovebox port (Item 8E1532A0975). It is 32″ (800 mm) long, ambidextrous, hand size ≈9.75″, and 0.4 mm (15 mil) thick ([demaco-vacuum.com](https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/#:~:text=32%E2%80%B3%20long%20%28800mm%29%2CHand%20size%209,4)). Sold per glove (not a pair) as “Spare Glovebox Gloves” ([demaco-vacuum.com](https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/#:~:text=32%E2%80%B3%20long%20%28800mm%29%2CHand%20size%209,4)). (Vendor: Demaco; URL: https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Exact product specification except thickness). *Recommendation: 0.72* – Demaco is a reputable specialty glovebox supplier and this listing matches the material, port size, length, and user size exactly ([demaco-vacuum.com](https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/#:~:text=32%E2%80%B3%20long%20%28800mm%29%2CHand%20size%209,4)). *Reason:* EPDM, 32″ length, ambidextrous and FDA-compliant as required for pharma use. *Concerns:* Offered thickness is 15 mil vs requested 8 mil (double the thickness). Slight concern that Demaco sells per glove, and availability may require a minimum order or take 1 week delivery ([demaco-vacuum.com](https://demaco-vacuum.com/product-category/glovebox-solvent-purification/spare-glovebox-gloves/epdm-glove/#:~:text=32%E2%80%B3%20long%20%28800mm%29%2CHand%20size%209,4mm%29%20thick)).  \n\n- **Albiox (Piercan) – *Isolator Glove EPDM black/white*** – Dual-layer EPDM (black outside, white lining) long isolator glove, halogen-free, powder-donned. Chemical-resistant (good vs H₂O₂, peracetic acid, etc.), UV/ozone resistant, FDA/CFR21-compliant ([albiox.com](https://albiox.com/product/epdm-black-epdm-white-isolator-glove/#:~:text=Black%20EPDM%20and%20White%20EPDM,on%20a%20secure%20connection%20ring)). Offered in two thickness grades: ~0.4 mm (16 mil) and ~0.6 mm (24 mil) ([albiox.com](https://albiox.com/product/epdm-black-epdm-white-isolator-glove/#:~:text=Thicknesses%3A)). It is typically 32″ in length (±20 mm tolerance) ([albiox.com](https://albiox.com/product/epdm-black-epdm-white-isolator-glove/#:~:text=,5%2F10)). Sold in packs of 10, lightly powdered ([albiox.com](https://albiox.com/product/epdm-black-epdm-white-isolator-glove/#:~:text=Packaging%20Individually%20packed%20in%20two,Pack%20of%2010%20units)). (Vendor: Albiox (distributor in Finland, global reach); Product URL: https://albiox.com/product/epdm-black-epdm-white-isolator-glove/)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Material and use match, but nominal thickness 16–24 mil). *Recommendation: 0.70* – Piercan (through Albiox) is a major glovebox glove maker (ISO certified). The two thickness options cover the needed EPDM type. *Reason:* Exact EPDM glove for isolator use; vendor is specialized and high-quality. *Concerns:* Thinner available version is still 16 mil (vs requested 8 mil). Pack and lot requirements (min 10) and sterilization status (sold sterile, etc.) must be clarified. Possibly longer lead time due to specialty product.  \n\n- **GloveBoxGloves (UK) – *EPDM Gauntlets & Sleeves*** – EPDM long sleeves (gloves) designed for glovebox and lab use. Made of EPDM with 0.4 mm (15 mil) thickness and provided 800 mm (31.5″) overall length ([gloveboxgloves.co.uk](https://gloveboxgloves.co.uk/product/edpm-gaunlets-and-sleeves/#:~:text=Colour%3A%20Black%20Port%20Sizes%20Diameter%3A%C2%A0203mm,4F%20to%20266F)). Available with cuff and O-ring fittings; smooth texture, antistatic, UV-resistant ([gloveboxgloves.co.uk](https://gloveboxgloves.co.uk/product/edpm-gaunlets-and-sleeves/#:~:text=%2A%20Manufactured%20from%20EPDM%2C%20Ethylene,UV%20Resistant)). The product listing (SKU G-EDP) describes 32″ gloves with hand size 9 and 8″/10″ port compatibility ([gloveboxgloves.co.uk](https://gloveboxgloves.co.uk/product/edpm-gaunlets-and-sleeves/#:~:text=Specification)). (Vendor: GloveBoxGloves, UK; URL: https://gloveboxgloves.co.uk/product/edpm-gaunlets-and-sleeves/)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Excellent match on length and material, slightly thicker). *Recommendation: 0.72* – Specialist glovebox supplier and global shipping available. *Reason:* Direct EPDM glove product with correct dimensions (close) and explicitly intended for lab/pharma glovebox use. *Concerns:* Thickness is 15 mil instead of 8 mil, and only hand size 9 listed. No explicit sterility certification mentioned. Stock status should be confirmed.  \n\n- **Glove Box Australia – *EPDM GLOVE – 8.5 – 4/10 – 800 – Ø156*** – Ambidextrous EPDM black glove (Piercan brand), hand size 8.5 (9″), 0.4 mm (15 mil) thick, 800 mm long ([www.labhub.au](https://www.labhub.au/products/epdm-glove-8-5-4-10-800mm-o156?Title=Default+Title#:~:text=Suitable%20for%20every%20glove%20box,manufacturers)). Designed for 156 mm (6.14″) glove port (part “4/10” indicates the port), FDA-food-contact compliant with high chemical resistance ([www.labhub.au](https://www.labhub.au/products/epdm-glove-8-5-4-10-800mm-o156?Title=Default+Title#:~:text=Black%20EPDM%20,2600)). Sold by the glove; MOQ 20 gloves. (Vendor: Glove Box Australia; URL: https://www.gloveboxaustralia.com.au/products/epdm-glove-8-5-4-10-800mm-o156)  \n  *Confidence: Medium* (Correct length and EPDM; thickness mismatch). *Recommendation: 0.70* – Reputable supplier in Asia-Pacific (sources Piercan gloves). Exact match of EPDM long glove (31.5″, size 8.5). *Reason:* Close spec and clear vendor specialization. *Concerns:* Only one thickness offered (0.4 mm). MOQ of 20 indicates bulk ordering; ensure availability.  \n\n- **Tarun Gloves (India) – *EPDM Isolator Gloves*** – EPDM heavyweight glove for gloveboxes. (Site only shows a general “EPDM Gloves” offering in “Isolator Gloves” category). Vendor claims EPDM material suitable for pharmaceutical environments ([www.tarungloves.com](https://www.tarungloves.com/isolator-gloves.html#:~:text=Color%20%20)). (Vendor: Tarun Gloves, India; URL: https://www.tarungloves.com/isolator-gloves.html)  \n  *Confidence: Low* (Vague details; no length or thickness given). *Recommendation: 0.50* – Indian manufacturer with EPDM chemical gloves. *Reason:* Material matches query (EPDM), and local presence could offer competitive pricing. *Concerns:* Lacks product specification (length, thickness not listed). Quality and certifications (FDA, ISO) are uncertain. Likely need to verify actual glove parameters and minimum order quantities."

[Product Page](https://www.westlab.com/disposable-vacuum-filter-funnel-mce-membrane-100ml-47mm-0-45um-sterile)  \n*Confidence:* High. *Score:* 0.9. *Reason:* Exact nominal specs (0.45 µm MCE, 100 mL, 47 mm) and sterile status clearly match. *Concerns:* Generic branding (Westlab); verify regulatory/certification as needed.  \n\n**Sterlitech – Disposable Filter Funnel, Sterile, 100 ml, Gridded, 0.45 µm, White (50/pk)**: Sterile disposable filter funnels (100 mL) with white gridded 0.45 µm MCE membrane, sold 50 per pack. [Product Page](https://www.sterlitech.com/microbiological-filter-funnel-af045w50.html) (Sterlitech listing)  \n*Confidence:* High. *Score:* 0.9. *Reason:* Matches all critical attributes (0.45 µm MCE, sterile, 100 ml) in a commercial lab supply context. *Concerns:* Use alternative vendor for Moist Markets; check pack count differences.  \n\nEach listed vendor offers a close or exact equivalent to catalog MMHAWG124. All meet the key specs (0.45 µm MCE membrane, 100 mL funnel), sterility, and are for microbiological use. Packaging and grid colors may vary, but these are functionally equivalent products from reputable suppliers."

The telescoping handle and wringer-less bucket enhance ergonomics and sterility. – **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.93. *Reason:* This is an exact match (full system) explicitly marketed for ISO-class cleanrooms and meets Annex 1 needs. *Concerns:* Vendor is specialized (but established in industry).\n\n**VWR (Texwipe®)** – *Product:* **ClipperMop™ Cleanroom Mop System**.  URL: (VWR US) [b2b-us.vwr.com/store/product/16730359/clippermoptm-cleanroom-mops](https://b2b-us.vwr.com/store/product/16730359/clippermoptm-cleanroom-mops) – Description: Texwipe’s ClipperMop™ is a patent-pending cleanroom mop head/frame system that clips disposable wipes (wet/dry/sterile) onto a thermoplastic mop head.

Compatible with standard disinfectants, it allows fast wiper changes without fiber shedding. Widely used in pharma/biotech for high-sensitivity areas. – **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.92. *Reason:* Direct product page from a leading lab supplier; system is explicitly for cleanrooms. *Concerns:* Sold via distributor site; ensure pricing/lead-time availability.\n\n**Vileda Professional** – *Product:* **CleanTech™ Duo Microfiber Mop (Cleanroom Duo Mop)**.  URL: (Vileda CE US) [ce.vileda-professional.com/vp_us/CE-Duo-System/CleanTech™-Duo-Microfiber-Mop/p/CleanTech_Duo_Microfibre_Laminated_Mop](https://ce.vileda-professional.com/vp_us/CE-Duo-System/CleanTech™-Duo-Microfiber-Mop/p/CleanTech_Duo_Microfibre_Laminated_Mop) – Description: Part of Vileda’s CE Swep Duo system, the CleanTech™ Duo Mop is a double-sided, microfiber/foam laminated mop head certified for ISO 5/GMP A/B use.

It’s used with Vileda’s CleanTech™ hardware (ergonomic handles, buckets) for cleanroom floors, walls, and ceilings. – **Confidence:** High. **Score:** 0.91. *Reason:* Exact cleanroom mop system from global brand; detailed product spec available. *Concerns:* Must source Vileda CE components (handles/buckets) separately, but core mop product matches spec.\n\n**Hydroflex** – *Product:* **PurMop® Z40 Reusable Cleanroom Mop**.  URL: (Hydroflex Group) [www.hydroflex-group.com/en/product/purmop-z40/](https://www.hydroflex-group.com/en/product/purmop-z40/) – Description: The PurMop Z40 is a heavy-duty reusable polyester/microfiber cleanroom mop head for ISO 3–8/GMP areas.

Comes in packs of 10 (50 per carton) and is compatible with Hydroflex mop frames/handles or universal systems. – **Confidence:** Medium-high. **Score:** 0.85. *Reason:* Official product spec from manufacturer; meets cleanroom criteria. *Concerns:* This is mop head only (no bucket included); needs compatible autoclavable handle/wringer. Availability may be more limited than global brands, but fits exact ISO/GMP requirements."

Score:** 0.95 – Exact Contec product, from a reputable distributor. **Reason:** Exact match to bucketless pharmaceutical mop head; user-oriented vendor site. **Concerns:** Sold in UK currency; verify shipping to India; Non-sterile (sterile gamma-irradiated version available separately).\n\n2. **Foamtec (PharmaMOP)** – *Foamtec PharmaMOP™ Cleanroom Mop Heads, Sterile* – [Product page](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/pharmamop-cleanroom-mop-heads-sterile/19304821) – This sterile mop head is part of Foamtec’s PharmaMOP system (high-capacity, drip-resistant design). It features a 0.125″ foam core with ultrapure polyester cover (gamma-irradiated, SAL 10⁻⁶) for heavy-duty disinfectant cleaning. Suitable for ISO 5-7 cleanrooms, compatible with bleach, IPA, etc. (Other styles include non-sterile and textured versions under same catalog). **Confidence:** Medium-High. **Rec. Score:** 0.80 – Good match in concept (drip-resistant, ergonomic handle system) and manufacturer. **Reason:** PharmaMOP is designed for aseptic processing areas and meets cleanroom standards; sold through Fisher Sci. **Concerns:** Not explicitly “bucketless” handle (requires manipulating scrubber), but described as “drip-resistant, no wringer”. Ensure it fits the internal-dispense handle system. Pricing and availability need checking.\n\n3. **SterileMate** – *EasyFlo™ Bucketless Mop System* – [Product page](https://sterilemate.com/product/easyflo-bucketless-mop-system/) – SterileMate’s EasyFlo is a bucketless floor mop system with a built-in reservoir (28 oz.) and palm-trigger dispensing. The site lists a starter kit (handle, tank, 18″ frame, 2 flat microfiber pads) and replacement handles. The mop covers up to ~3000 ft², with a lightweight aluminum frame. Kits include 18″ flat wet mop pads (sold separately). **Confidence:** Medium. **Rec. Score:** 0.65 – Close match, intended for clean/sterile areas. **Reason:** Explicitly bucketless design, marketed for sterile environments. **Concerns:** Smaller capacity (28 oz vs 52 oz), not explicitly ISO-certified; primarily shows system overview, less technical detail. Availability and India shipping must be verified.\n\n4. **Hillyard/Boardwalk** – *Boardwalk Bucketless Microfiber Mop System, 18″ W, Blue* – [Product page](https://www.hillyard.com/Wet-Mops/Boardwalk-Bucketless-Microfiber-Mop-System-18-W-Blue/p/BWKBWMS16MFM) – A general-purpose bucketless mop kit with a 865 mL internal tank and 18″ wide microfiber pad. The design dispenses solution directly to the mop head’s high-weight microfiber pad. Marketed for efficiency (saves water/chemicals, reduces contamination). **Confidence:** Low-Medium. **Rec. Score:** 0.50 – Fair match (true bucketless concept) but not specifically “pharmaceutical grade”. **Reason:** Well-known janitorial brand (Boardwalk) selling a bucketless system, so conceptually fits. **Concerns:** No claims of cleanroom/GMP compliance or certification; not gamma-sterilizable; likely not validated for particle/contamination control in pharma settings.\n\n5. **Biomed Pharmacare (India)** – *Bucketless Mopping System for Pharma Use* – [Product page](https://www.indiamart.com/proddetail/bucketless-mopping-system-for-pharma-use-20635866191.html) – An Indian-made mop system described as “bucketless” for pharmaceutical use. Features a plastic handle and looped-end microfiber mop head (red) with no separate bucket. **Confidence:** Low. **Rec. Score:** 0.35 – Loose match. **Reason:** Claims to be bucketless and intended for pharma, and is an India-based manufacturer (potential for local procurement). **Concerns:** Product details are minimal (IndiaMART listing only). “Dry mop” suggests it may not involve dispensing liquids. No information on cleanroom certification or compliance; quality and applicability are unclear. Highest caution on fit for critical environments."

This is the original PathHunter chemiluminescent detection kit (lysis buffer + EFC substrate) for use with PathHunter cell lines.  It delivers enzyme-fragment complementation (EFC) readout of GPCR β-arrestin recruitment.  Confidence: **High (exact match)**.  URL is verified working (manufacturer site).  Recommendation score: **1.0** – tier-1 reputation, exact product match, proven RUO assay for regulated research.  Reason: DiscoverX is the developer of PathHunter; high-quality assay, widely used in pharma.  Concerns: Requires proprietary PathHunter cell lines (not included); kit is RUO and may have limited regional distribution stock.\n\n**Revvity (Cisbio/PerkinElmer)** – *HTRF® β-Arrestin 2 Recruitment Kit, 1,000 Assay Points*; product page: **https://www.revvity.com/product/htrf-b-arr2-recruitment-kit-1k-pts-62bdbar2peb**.  This homogenous TR-FRET assay kit measures β-arrestin 2 recruitment (GPCR signaling bias) in live cells.  It uses HTRF technology for time-resolved FRET readout.   Confidence: **High**.  URL is working (Revvity product page).  Rec score: **0.9** – major specialized supplier, validated GPCR assay.  Reason: Cisbio/Revity (Merck/Danaher) is a trusted global supplier of GPCR cell-signaling kits (HTRF).  Concerns: Research Use Only; requires time-resolved fluorescence reader; kit contents (antibodies/dyes) must be stored carefully.\n\n**AAT Bioquest** – *Cell Meter™ β-Arrestin Translocation GPCR Signaling Kit*; product page: **https://www.aatbio.com/products/cell-meter-beta-arrestin-translocation-gpcr-signaling-kit**.  A fluorescence-based cell assay kit that detects β-arrestin translocation to activated GPCRs.  Kit includes a proprietary fluorescent probe and buffers for imaging or plate-reader assays.  Confidence: **Medium-High** (close functional equivalent).  URL verified.  Rec score: **0.75** – established assay provider in cell signaling.  Reason: AATBioquest is a reputable biotech with multiple cell-based assay kits; this kit addresses the same GPCR β-arrestin endpoint.  Concerns: Technology differs (fluorescent probe vs luminescent EFC); ensure compatible fluorescence reader; confirm kit availability and species applicability.\n\n**Merck Millipore (MilliporeSigma)** – *cAMP Direct Immunoassay Kit, Colorimetric (Cat.116811)*; product page: **https://www.merckmillipore.com/INTL/en/product/cAMP-Direct-Immunoassay-Kit-Colorimetric,EMD_BIO-116811**.  A competitive ELISA kit for quantitative measurement of cAMP in cells (GPCR Gi/Gs pathway readout).  Non-radioactive colorimetric assay for cellular cAMP (HCl cell lysis).  Confidence: **High** (well-established GPCR assay).  URL working.  Rec score: **0.85** – top-tier (MilliporeSigma), broad research use.  Reason: Industry-leading supplier of biochemical kits; cAMP assay is relevant for GPCR functional screens.  Concerns: Provides second-messenger readout rather than direct PPI; requires cell lysis; stock status shows *limited availability*, so lead time may apply.\n\n**Enzo Life Sciences** – *cAMP ELISA Kit (Colorimetric, ADI-900-067A)*; product page: **https://www.enzo.com/product/camp-elisa-kit/**.  A colorimetric competitive ELISA for extracellular cAMP (GPCR Gs signaling).  Includes acetylation step for increased sensitivity (~0.027 pmol/ml).  Confidence: **Medium**.  URL verified.  Rec score: **0.6** – trusted kit manufacturer but assay is indirect (second-messenger).  Reason: Enzo is a known global supplier of research kits; this assay covers GPCR activity via cAMP.  Concerns: Less direct than β-arrestin readout; kit usage (sample prep) is more involved; requiring acetylation reagent; company may restrict quantities or require account login for pricing."

Eppendorf is well-known and that model meets the volume/parallel requirements.  \n  **Reasons:** Tier-1 manufacturer; the DASbox Mini specifically lists 60–250 mL and up to 24 vessels. It offers modular expansion and automation compatibility, making it highly suitable for scalable upstream development.  \n  **Concerns:** None critical. (Eppendorf products are globally supported, though the Thai/English site was used – a US/EN URL could be substituted if needed; offering multiple language indicates wide availability.)\n\n- **Manufacturer:** INFORS HT (Merck Millipore) – *Multifors® 2 Bench-Top Parallel Bioreactor System* – [Product Page](https://infors-ht.com/en/products/bioreactors/bench-top-bioreactors/multifors-2)  \n  **Description:** A configurable parallel benchtop reactor system. One control unit can run up to 6 vessels (glass), with vessel options including 400 mL (115–250 mL working volume) ([infors-ht.com](https://infors-ht.com/en/products/bioreactors/bench-top-bioreactors/multifors-2#:~:text=Product%20specifications)), 750 mL (180–500 mL working), or 1400 mL (320–1000 mL). Magnetic drives and integrated pumps/MFCs minimize footprint. Designed for microbial/fermentation use, it allows similar sensors and scales as production systems.  \n  **URL Verified:** Yes (loads product info and specs).  \n  **Confidence:** High – INFORS HT (now part of Merck Life Science) is a recognized biotech equipment manufacturer.  \n  **Recommendation:** 0.8 – Strong alternative. Known parallel system with matching scale (115–250 mL).  \n  **Reasons:** INFORS is an established bioreactor supplier (infors-ht.com). The Multifors 2 explicitly supports 115–250 mL working volumes per vessel, matching ambr’s range. Its parallel design (up to 6-fold) and industrial-grade sensors suit scalable applications.  \n  **Concerns:** The website shows glass vessels (not single-use). If single-use or disposable elements are needed, additional components or adaptation might be required. However, INFORS does offer single-use options on request.\n\n- **Manufacturer:** PBS Biotech – *PBS-0.1 Mini Vertical-Wheel Bioreactor* – [Product Page](https://www.pbsbiotech.com/pbs-01-mini-bioreactors)  \n  **Description:** A specialized single-use bioreactor for cell culture (stem cells, immunotherapies). Uses a patented vertical-wheel mixing system. Supports working volumes of ~60–100 mL ([www.pbsbiotech.com](https://www.pbsbiotech.com/pbs-01-mini-bioreactors#:~:text=The%20PBS,scale%20production)) (bench-scale). It is a benchtop system (PBS-Mini base unit) with enclosed single-use vessels; simple aseptic handling and regulatory-compliant materials (ideal for cell therapy development).  \n  **URL Verified:** Yes (official product page).  \n  **Confidence:** Medium – PBS Biotech is an emerging but reputable company in advanced bioreactors.  \n  **Recommendation:** 0.7 – Good specialty alternative, but note volume range slightly smaller.   \n  **Reasons:** PBS is known for cutting-edge single-use vessel technology. The PBS-0.1 Mini matches small-volume range (60–100 mL) and is built for high cell viability. It may serve similar experiments, especially where gentle mixing (vertical impeller) is desired.  \n  **Concerns:** Working volume max (100 mL) is below 250 mL, so users needing higher volume would have to use fewer vessels or scale up to PBS-0.5 model. It’s designed for cell therapy processes, so microbial fermentations might not be its focus. Ensure compatibility with process needs.\n\n- **Manufacturer:** H.E.L Group – *BioXplorer® 100 (Parallel 8 Bioreactor Platform)* – [Product Page](https://helgroup.com/products/bioreactors/bioxplorer-100/)  \n  **Description:** A multi-parallel stirred-tank system for aerobic cultures, with 8 configurable bioreactor vessels. Working volume range is ~50–150 mL per vessel ([helgroup.com](https://helgroup.com/products/bioreactors/bioxplorer-100/#:~:text=The%20BioXplorer%20100%20is%20a,as%2050%20ml%2C%C2%A0%20the%20BioXplorer)). Each reactor has a glass body and stainless lid; sensors can be independently configured. Controlled by H.E.L’s WinISO system. Emphasizes automated liquid/addition control and high-throughput data.  \n  **URL Verified:** Yes (working product page with specs).  \n  **Confidence:** Medium – H.E.L Group is a smaller specialized manufacturer, mainly known in fermentation R&D.  \n  **Recommendation:** 0.6 – Acceptable as an alternative.  \n  **Reasons:** The BioXplorer 100 meets the concept (parallel bioreactors, ~50–150 mL) closely. H.E.L is ISO-certified and serves pharma/biotech labs. This platform is used for fermentation screening and process development.  \n  **Concerns:** Less well-known than Tier-1 brands. Maximum volume (150 mL) is below 250 mL, so uses slightly smaller vessels; however, multiple runs can compensate. Regional availability may vary; confirm local support or lead times."
