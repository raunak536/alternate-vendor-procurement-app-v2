CONTEXT: This project addresses a biopharma procurement use case, focusing on providing solutions for alternate vendors. The goal is to prototype and ideate both backend and frontend within this workspace, ensuring they remain aligned throughout development.

Guidelines:
- Design lightweight, elegant UIs with a minimal and cohesive style inspired by Apple—favoring smooth, subtle, and premium aesthetics.
- Backend should be simple, maintainable, and seamlessly integrate with the frontend.
- Avoid heavy animations, bright colors, or overly complex code on either the frontend or backend.
- Prioritize clarity and alignment between design, functionality, and user experience.
